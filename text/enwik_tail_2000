      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:John_Ray.jpg|thumb|200px|John Ray.]]
'''John Ray''' ([[November 29]], [[1627]] &amp;ndash; [[January 17]], [[1705]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Natural history|naturalist]], sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history. Until [[1670]] he wrote his name as John Wray. 

He published important works on [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[natural theology]]. His classification of plants in his ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre-conceived, either/or type system, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. Thus he advanced [[empiricism|scientific empiricism]] against the [[deductive rationalism]] of the scholastics.

== Early life ==
Ray was born in the [[village]] of [[Black Notley]], near [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]], in the [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Essex]], in the south east of [[England]]. He is said to have been born in the [[forge|smithy]], his father having been the [[blacksmith]] of [[Black Notley]] near [[Braintree]]. From Braintree school he was sent at the age of sixteen to [[Catharine Hall, Cambridge]], whence he removed to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] after about one year and three-quarters. His tutor at Trinity was [[James Duport]], [[Regius Professor of Greek (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Greek]], and his intimate friend and fellow-pupil the celebrated [[Isaac Barrow]]. Ray was chosen minor fellow of Trinity in [[1649]], and in due course became a major fellow on proceeding to the [[master's degree]]. He held many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek (1651), mathematics (1653),and humanity (1655), ''praelector'' (1657), junior dean (1657), and college steward (1659 and 1660); and according to the habit of the time, he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at [[St Mary the Great with St Michael, Cambridge|Great St Mary's]] before the university, long before he took holy orders. Among his sermons preached before his ordination, which was not till the [[23 December]], [[1660]], were the famous discourses on ''The Wisdom of God in the Creation'', and on ''The Chaos, Deluge and Dissolution of the World''. Ray's reputation was high also as a tutor; and he communicated his own passion for natural history to several pupils, of whom [[Francis Willughby]] is by far the most famous.

== Career ==
Ray's quiet college life closed when he found himself unable to subscribe to the [[Act of Uniformity 1661]], and was obliged to give up his fellowship in 1662, the year after [[Isaac Newton]] had entered the college. We are told by Dr Derham in his ''Life of Ray'' that the reason of his refusal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;was not (as some have imagined) his having taken the 'Solemn League and Covenant,' for that he never did, and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath; but he said he could not declare for those that had taken the oath that no obligation lay upon them, but feared there might&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his pupil Willughby, who made Ray his constant companion while he lived, and at his death left him 6 shillings a year, with the charge of educating his two sons.

In the spring of [[1663]] Ray started together with Willughby and two other pupils on a tour through [[Europe]], from which he returned in March 1666, parting from Willughby at [[Montpellier]], whence the latter continued his journey into [[Spain]]. He had previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by [[George Scott]] in 1760, under the title of ''Mr Ray's Itineraries''. Ray himself published an account of his foreign travel in 1673, entitled ''Observations topographical, moral, and physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy, and France''. From this tour Ray and Willughby returned laden with collections, on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Willughby undertook the former part, but, dying in 1672, left only an ornithology and ichthyology, in themselves vast, for Ray to edit; while the latter used the botanical collections for the groundwork of his ''Methodus planiarurn nova'' (1682), and his great ''Historia generalis plantarum'' (3 vols., 1686, 1688, 1704). The plants gathered on his British tours had already been described in his ''Catalogus plantarum Angliae'' (1670), which work is the basis of all later English floras.

In 1667 Ray was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1669 he published in conjunction with Willughby his first paper in the Philosophical Transactions on ''Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees''. They demonstrated the ascent of the sap through the wood of the tree, and supposed the sap to precipitate a kind of white coagulum or jelly, which may be well conceived to be the part which every year between bark and tree turns to wood and of which the leaves and fruits are made. Immediately after his admission into the Royal Society he was induced by Bishop [[John Wilkins]] to translate his ''Real Character'' into Latin, and it seems he actually completed a translation, which, however, remained in manuscript; his ''Methodus plantarum nova'' was in fact undertaken as a part of Wilkins's great classificatory scheme.

In [[1673]] Ray married Margaret Oakley of [[Launton]]; in 1676 he went to [[Sutton Coldfield]], and in 1677 to Falborne Hall in [[Essex]]. Finally, in 1679, he removed to Black Notley, where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet and uneventful, although he had poor health, including chronic sores. He occupied himself in writing books and in keeping up a wide scientific correspondence, and lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age of seventy-six, dying at Black Notley on [[17 January]], 1705. The [[Ray Society]], for the publication of works on natural history, was founded in his honor in [[1844]].

== Works ==
Ray's first book, the ''Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium'' (1660, followed by appendices in 1663 and 1685), was written in conjunction with his ''amicissimus et individuus comes'', [[John Nid]]. The 626 plants are listed alphabetically, but a system of classification differing little from [[Caspar Bauhin]]'s is sketched at the end of the book; and the notes contain many references to other parts of natural history. The locations of the plants are minutely described; and Cambridge students still gather some of their rarer plants in the copses or chalk-pits where he found them. The book shows signs of his indebtedness to [[Joachim Jung]] of [[Hamburg]], who had died in 1657, leaving his writings unpublished; but a manuscript copy of some of them was sent to Ray by [[Samuel Hartlib]] in 1660. Jung invented or gave precision to many technical terms which Ray and others at once made use of in their descriptions, and which are now classical; and his notions of what constitutes a specific distinction and what characters are valueless as such seem to have been adopted with little change by Ray. The first two editions of the ''Catalogus plantarum Angliae'' (1670, 1677) were likewise arranged alphabetically; but in the ''Synopsis stirpium rum'' (1690, 1696, also re-edited by Dillenius, 1724, and by Hill, 1760) Ray applied the scheme of classification which he had by that time elaborated in the ''Methodus'' and the ''Historia plantarum''. The ''Methodus plantarum nova'' (1682) was largely based on the works of [[Caesalpinus]] and Jung, and still more on that of [[Robert Morison]] of Oxford. The greatest merit of this book is the use of the number of [[cotyledons]] as a basis of classification; though it must be remembered that the difference between the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous embryo was detected by [[Nehemiah Grew]]. After dividing plants into flowerless and flowering, Ray says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Floriferas dividemus in Dicotyledones. auarum semina sata binis foliis anomalis, seminalibus dictis, quae cotyledonorum usum praestant, e terra exeunt, yel in binos saltem lobos dividuntur, quamvis eos supra terrem foliorum specie non efferunt; et Monocotyledones, quae nec folia bina seminalia efferunt nec lobos binos condunt. Haec divisio ad arbores etiam extendi potest; siquidem Palmae et congeneres hoc respectu eodem modo a reliquis arboribus differunt quo Monocotyledones a reliquis herbis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But a serious blemish was his persistent separation of trees from herbs, a distinction whose falsity had been exposed by Jung and others, but to which Ray tried to give scientific foundation by denying the existence of buds in the latter. At this time he based his classification, like Caesalpinus, chiefly upon the fruit, and he distinguished several natural groups, such as the grasses, ''[[Labiatae]]'', ''[[Umbelliferae]]'' and ''[[Papilionaceae]]''. 

The classification of the ''Methodus'' was extended and improved in the ''Historia plantarum'', but was disfigured by a large class of Anomalae, to include forms that the other orders did not easily admit, and by the separation of the cereals from other grasses. This vast book enumerates and describes all the plants known to the author or described by his predecessors, to the number, according to Adanson, of 18,625 species. In the first volume a chapter ''De plantis in genere'' contains an account of all the anatomical and physiological knowledge of the time regarding plants, with the recent speculations and discoveries of Caesalpinus, Grew, Malpighi and Jung; and Cuvier and Dupetit Thouars, declaring that it was this chapter which gave acceptance and authority to these authors works, say that the best monument that could be erected to the memory of Ray would be the republication of this part of his work separately. The ''Stirpium Europaearum extra Britannias nascentium Sylloge'' (1694) is a much amplified edition of the catalogue of plants collected on his own European tour. In the preface to this book he first clearly admitted the doctrine of the sexuality of plants, which, however, he had no share in establishing. Here also begins his long controversy with Rivinus ([[Augustus Quirinus Bachmann]]) which chiefly turned upon Ray's indefensible separation of ligneous, from herbaceous plants, and also upon what he conceived to be the misleading reliance that Rivinus placed on the characters of the corolla. But in the second edition of his ''Methodus'' (1703) he followed Rivinus and [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in taking the flower instead of the fruit as his basis of classification: he was no longer a fructicist but a corollist.

Besides editing his friend Willughby's books, Ray wrote several zoological works of his own, including ''Synopsis methodica Animalium Quadrupedum et Serpentini Generis'' (1693), that is to say, both mammals and reptiles, and ''Synopsis methodica Aviusn et Piscium'' (1713); the latter was published posthumously, as was also the more important ''Historia Insectorum'', which embodied a great mass of Willughbys notes.

Most of Ray's minor works were the outcome of his faculty for carefully amassing facts; for instance, his ''Collection of English Proverbs'' (1670), his ''Collection of Out-of-the-way English Words'' (1674), his ''Collection of Curious Travels and Voyages'' (1693), and his ''Dictionariolum trilingue'' (1675, 5th edition as Nomenclator classicus, 1706). The last was written for the use of Willughby's sons, his pupils; it passed through many edtions, and is still useful for its careful identifications of plants and animals mentioned by Greek and Latin writers. But Ray's influence and reputation have depended largely upon his two books entitled ''The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation'' (1691), and ''Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World'' (1692). The latter includes three essays on ''The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World'', ''The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects'', and ''The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations''. The germ of these works was contained in sermons preached long before in Cambridge. Both books obtained immediate popularity, and the former, at least, was translated into several languages. In ''The Wisdom of God'' Ray recites innumerable examples of the perfection of organic mechanism, the multitude and variety of living creatures, the minuteness and usefulness of their parts, and many, if not most, of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature were suggested by him, such as the structure of the eye, the hollowness of the bones, the camel's stomach and the hedgehog's armour.

== Legacy ==
In [[1986]], to mark the 300th anniversary of the publication of Ray's ''Historia Plantarum'', there was a celebration of Ray's legacy in Braintree. A &quot;John Ray Gallery&quot; was opened in the Braintree Museum. The scientific society at his old college is named the &quot;John Ray Society&quot; after him.

The standard [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|botanical author abbreviation]] '''Ray''' is applied to [[species]] he described.

'''John Fitzgerald Kennedy''' ([[May 29]], [[1917]] &amp;ndash; [[November 22]], [[1963]]), often referred to as '''John F. Kennedy''', '''JFK''', or '''Jack Kennedy''', was the 35th [[President of the United States]]. He served from 1961 until [[John F. Kennedy assassination|his assassination]] in 1963. A member of the prominent [[Kennedy family|Kennedy political family]], he is considered an icon of [[American liberalism]]. During [[World War II]], he served as a naval lieutenant in the Pacific theatre and was cited for exceptional bravery for the rescue of his men. Kennedy is the youngest person ever to have been elected president of the United States, at the age of 43. ([[Theodore Roosevelt]] was the youngest ever to ''serve'' as President of the United States, as he succeeded to the presidency at age 42, following President [[William McKinley|McKinley's]] assassination.)		
 		
Major events during his presidency included the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the failed prevention of the Israeli nuclear weapons program, the failed prevention of the Chinese nuclear weapons program, the building of the [[Berlin Wall]], the [[Space Race]], early events of the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]. In [[Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents|rankings of U.S. presidents]], historians usually grade Kennedy above average, but among the general public he is often regarded as among the greatest presidents.		
 		
Kennedy is also the first and only [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Roman Catholic]] ever to become President, the first president to serve who was born in the [[20th century]], the last to die while still in office, the last [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from the [[Northern United States|North]] to be elected, and the last to be elected while serving in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].		
Kennedy died the youngest of any U.S. president, at 46 years and 177 days, when he was assassinated on [[November 22]], [[1963]]. The assassination is often considered a defining moment in U.S. history because of its traumatic impact on the entire nation, its impact on the political history of the ensuing decades, and because of Kennedy's elevation as an [[icon]] for a new generation of Americans and American aspirations.		
 		
==Early Life==	
	
Kennedy was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] and [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald]]. 		
 		
Years later, it would be revealed that Kennedy had been diagnosed as a young man with [[Addison's Disease]], a rare endocrine disorder. This and other medical disorders were kept from the press, and the public, throughout Kennedy's life.		
 		
Kennedy attended [[Edward Devotion School]] for four years ([[Kindergarten]] in [[1922]] to Third Grade [http://www.jfklibrary.org/fa_edward_devotion_school.html]) and then [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] in [[Connecticut]], one of the country's most elite private boarding schools, from which he graduated in 1935. That fall (Sept 25, 1935) he sailed from New York to London with his parents and his sister [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]]. There he enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]] with the intention of studying for a year ([[political economy]] under the tutelage of Professor [[Harold Laski]]) but an illness hospitalized him shortly after his enrollment. His father insisted he return to the US. Jack sailed from London for New York on Oct 26, 1935. Later that fall of 1935, he enrolled in [[Princeton University]], but was forced to leave after contracting [[jaundice]]. The next fall, he began attending [[Harvard College]]. Kennedy traveled to [[Europe]] twice during his years at Harvard, visiting the [[United Kingdom]], while his father was serving as [[Ambassador]] to the [[Court of St. James's]]. In 1937, Kennedy was prescribed [[steroid]]s to control his [[colitis]], which only heightened his medical problems causing him to develop [[osteoporosis]] of the lower [[lumbar spine]] [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1276266]. 		
 		
In 1940 Kennedy wrote his honors thesis, entitled &quot;[[Why England Slept]]&quot; on the British portion of the [[Munich Agreement]]. He initially intended for the thesis to be for college only, but his dad encouraged him to publish the book. He graduated ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'' from Harvard with a degree in [[international affairs]] in June 1940. His thesis was published in 1940 [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=24144268] and became a [[best-seller]].

==Military service==		
In the spring of 1941, Kennedy volunteered for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], but was rejected, mainly because of his troublesome back. However, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] accepted him in September of that year with the influence of the director of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI), a former naval [[attaché]] to Ambassador Joseph Kennedy. As an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]], he served in the office that supplied bulletins and briefing information for the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. It was during this assignment that the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] occurred. It was also during this time that he began a romantic relationship with [[Inga Arvad]], a suspected [[Nazi]] spy. The relationship ended, however, when Kennedy was transferred to the ONI field office in [[South Carolina]]. He attended the Naval Reserve Officers Training School and Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Training Center before being assigned for duty in [[Panama]] and eventually the [[Pacific theater]]. He participated in various commands in the Pacific theater and earned the rank of [[lieutenant]], commanding a [[patrol torpedo boat]] (''PT boat'').[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq60-2.htm]
 		
[[Image:JFKPT109.jpg|thumb|right|200px|John on his navy patrol boat, [[PT 109]].]]		
On [[August 2]], [[1943]], Kennedy's boat, the ''[[PT-109]]'', was taking part in a night-time military raid near [[New Georgia]] (near the [[Solomon Islands]]) when it was rammed by a [[Japan]]ese [[destroyer]]. Kennedy was thrown across the deck, injuring his already troubled back. Still, Kennedy somehow towed a wounded man three miles through the ocean, arriving on an island where his crew was subsequently rescued. Kennedy said that he blacked out for periods of time during the ordeal. For these actions, Kennedy received the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]], awarded for heroism not involving conflict with the enemy under the following citation:		
 		
:For heroism the rescue of 3 men following the ramming and sinking of his motor torpedo boat while attempting a torpedo attack on a Japanese destroyer in the Solomon Islands area on the night of Aug 12, 1943. Lt. KENNEDY, Capt. of the boat, directed the rescue of the crew and personally rescued 3 men, one of whom was seriously injured. During the following 6 days, he succeeded in getting his crew ashore, and after swimming many hours attempting to secure aid and food, finally effected the rescue of the men. His courage, endurance and excellent leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.		
 		
Kennedy's other decorations from the Second World War include the [[Purple Heart]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], and the [[World War II Victory Medal]]. He was honorably discharged in early 1945, just a few months before Japan surrendered.		
 		
In May 2002, a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] expedition found what is believed to be the wreckage of the ''[[PT-109]]'' in the Solomon Islands [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/07/0709_020710_kennedyPT109.html].

==Early political career==		
[[Image:JFKSENATE.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A young Senator Kennedy in 1953.]]		
After World War II, Kennedy entered politics (partly to fill the void of his popular brother, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], on whom his family had pinned many of their hopes but who was killed in the war). In 1946, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[James Michael Curley]] vacated his seat in an overwhelmingly Democratic district to become mayor of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and Kennedy ran for that seat, beating his Republican opponent by a large margin. He was reelected twice, but had a mixed voting record, often diverging from President [[Harry S. Truman]] and the rest of the Democratic Party.

Kennedy married [[Jacqueline Lee Bouvier]] on [[September 12]], [[1953]]. He underwent several spinal operations in the two following years, nearly dying (receiving the Catholic faith's [[Anointing of the Sick|&quot;last rites&quot;]] four times during his life), and was often absent from the Senate. During this period, he published ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', highlighting eight instances in which U.S. Senators risked their careers by standing by their personal beliefs. The book was awarded the 1957 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Biography.

==McCarthy's support from the Kennedy family==		
After 1950, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] was the nation's most prominent [[Irish-American]] along with the [[Kennedy family]]. Even before becoming famous, McCarthy forged a close friendship with [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], who contributed thousands of dollars to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. Joseph Kennedy often brought him to Hyannis Port as a weekend house guest in the late 1940s. McCarthy at one point dated Patricia Kennedy, JFK's sister. In the Senate race of 1952, Joseph allegedly worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the GOP ticket in Massachusetts. In return, John F. Kennedy would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear. In 1953, at the father's urging, McCarthy hired [[Robert Kennedy]] (age 27) as a senior staff member. In 1954, when the Senate was threatening to condemn McCarthy, Senator Kennedy faced a dilemma. &quot;How could I demand that Joe McCarthy be censured for things he did when my own brother was on his staff?&quot; asked Kennedy. By 1954, however, Robert Kennedy and McCarthy's chief aide, [[Roy Cohn]], had had a falling out and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy. John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy, but he never delivered it. When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, Senator Kennedy was in the hospital and never indicated then or later how he would vote.		
 		
==Senator, 1953-60==		
In [[U.S. Senate election, 1952|1952]], Kennedy ran for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] with the slogan &quot;Kennedy will do more for Massachusetts.&quot; In an [[upset]] victory, he defeated Republican incumbent [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] by a margin of about 70,000 votes. 		
 		
In 1956, Kennedy campaigned for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] nomination at the [[Democratic National Convention]], but convention delegates selected [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] instead. However, Kennedy's efforts helped bolster his reputation within the party.		
 		
An example of Kennedy's political suppleness prior to the 1960 campaign was his handling of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]]. He voted for final passage, while earlier voting for the &quot;jury trial amendment&quot;, which some people feel rendered the Act toothless. He was able to say to both sides that he supported them.		
 		
In 1958, Kennedy published the first edition of his book ''[[A Nation of Immigrants]]'', closely following his involvement in the Displaced Persons Act and the 1957 bill to bring families together.

==[[1960 presidential election]]==		
[[Image:Jfknixon.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Kennedy and Richard Nixon shake hands before one of the 1960 televised debates.]]		
In 1960, Kennedy declared his intent to run for President of the United States. In the Democratic [[primary election]], he faced challenges from Senator [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]], Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]], and [[Adlai Stevenson]], the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956 who was not officially running but was a favorite write-in candidate. Kennedy won key primaries like [[Wisconsin]] and [[West Virginia]]. In the latter state, Kennedy made a visit to a coal mine, and talked to the mine workers to win their support, as most people in that [[conservative]], mostly [[Protestant]] state were deeply suspicious about Kennedy being a Catholic. Kennedy emerged as a universally acceptable candidate for the party after that victory.		
 		
On [[July 13]], [[1960]] the Democratic Party nominated Kennedy as its candidate for president. Kennedy asked Johnson to be his Vice Presidential candidate, despite clashes between the two during the primary elections. He needed Johnson's strength in the South to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since 1916. Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Catholicism, [[Cuba]], and whether or not both the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the U.S. To allay fears that his Roman Catholicism would impact his decision making, he said in a famous speech in [[Houston, Texas]] (to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association), on [[September 12]], [[1960]], &quot;I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters  and the Church does not speak for me.&quot; [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/johnfkennedyhoustonministerialspeech.html] {{seealso|Alfred E. Smith}}		
 		
In September and October, Kennedy debated Republican candidate Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised [[U.S. presidential election debates|US presidential debates]]. During the debates, Nixon looked tense, sweaty, and unshaven compared to Kennedy's composure and handsomeness, leading many to deem Kennedy the winner, although historians consider the two evenly matched as orators. Interestingly, many who listened on radio thought Nixon more impressive in the debate. [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kennedy-nixon/kennedy-nixon.htm] The debates are considered a political landmark: the point at which the medium of [[television]] played an important role in politics and looking presentable on camera became one of the important considerations for presidential and other political candidates. 		
 		
In the general [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|election]] on [[November 8]], [[1960]], Kennedy beat Nixon in a very close race. There were serious allegations that [[Electoral fraud|vote fraud]] in [[Texas]] and [[Illinois]] had cost Nixon the presidency[http://www.leanleft.com/archives/cat_reviews.html]. There were unusually large margins in [[Richard J. Daley|Richard Daley]]'s Chicago &amp;mdash; which were announced after the rest of the vote in Illinois. The only change after the official recount was a win for Kennedy in [[Hawaii]].

==Presidency 1961-1963 ==		
[[Image:Jfkspeech.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Kennedy gives his memorable [[inauguration address]]]]	
===Policies===	
Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th [[President]] on [[January 20]], [[1961]]. In his [[inaugural address]] he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens. &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country&quot;, he said. He also asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the &quot;common enemies of man: [[tyranny]], [[poverty]], [[disease]], and [[war]] itself.&quot; [http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/jfk-inaug.htm]		
 		
===Foreign policies===		
On [[April 17]], [[1961]], Kennedy gave orders allowing a previously planned invasion of Cuba to proceed. With support from the [[CIA]], in what is known as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], 1,500 U.S.trained Cuban exiles, called &quot;Brigade 2506&quot; returned to the island in the hope of deposing [[Fidel Castro|Castro]], but the [[CIA]] had underestimated popular support for Castro, made several mistakes in devising and carrying out the plan, and the exiles did not rally the Cuban people as expected. By [[April 19]] Castro's government had killed or captured most of the invading exiles and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After 20 months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53 million worth of food and medicine. The incident was a major embarrassment for Kennedy, but he took full responsibility. Historians in 2006 ranked the debacle as the #8 worst presidential mistake ever made.[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060218/presidential_errors_060218/20060218?hub=World]
	
On [[August 13]], [[1961]], the [[East German]] government began construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] separating East Berlin from the Western sector of the city, due to the American military presence in [[West Berlin]]. Kennedy claimed this action was in violation of the &quot;[[Four Powers]]&quot; agreements. Kennedy initiated no action to have it dismantled, and did little to reverse or halt the eventual extension of this barrier to a length of 155 km.		
[[Image:Zahir_shah_and_kenedy.gif|thumb|King of [[Afghanistan]] [[Zahir Shah]] (right) and US President John F. Kennedy (left)]]		
 		
The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] began on [[October 14]], [[1962]] when American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] [[spy plane]]s took photographs of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intermediate range ballistic missile site under construction in Cuba. Kennedy faced a dire dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites it might have led to [[nuclear war]] with the [[U.S.S.R.]] If the U.S. did nothing, it would endure the perpetual threat of nuclear weapons within its region, in such close proximity as to make retaliation for a preemptive launch very unlikely. Another fear was that the U.S. would appear to the world as weak in its own hemisphere. Many military officials and cabinet members pressed for an air assault on the missile sites but Kennedy ordered a naval [[quarantine]] in which the U.S. Navy inspected all ships. He began negotiations with the Soviets and a week later, he and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reached an agreement. Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles while the U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba, and also secretly promised to remove U.S. ballistic missiles from [[Turkey]] and [[Italy]] within six months. Following this incident, which brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since, Kennedy was more cautious in confronting the Soviet Union. 		
 		
[[Image:Kennedyarms.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[coat of arms]] of John F Kennedy blazoned ''Sable three helmets in profile Or within a bordure per saltire Gules and Ermine''.]]		
 		


Arguing that &quot;those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable&quot;, Kennedy sought to contain [[communism]] in [[Latin America]], by establishing the [[Alliance for Progress]], which sent aid to troubled countries in the region and sought greater [[human rights]] standards in the region. He worked closely with [[Puerto Rican]] [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]] [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] for the development of the Alliance of Progress, as well as developments on the autonomy of the Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]].		
 		
Another example of Kennedy's belief in the ability of non-military power to improve the world was the creation of the [[Peace Corps]], one of his first acts as president. Through this program, which still exists today, Americans volunteered to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as [[education]], [[farming]], [[health care]], and [[construction]].		
Kennedy also used limited military action to contain the spread of communism. Determined to stand firm against the spread of communism, Kennedy continued the previous administration's policy of political, economic, and military support for the unstable [[South Vietnam|South Vietnamese]] government, which included sending military advisers and U.S. Special Forces to the area. U.S. involvement in the area continually escalated until regular U.S. forces were directly fighting the [[Vietnam War]] in the next administration.		
 		
On [[June 26]], [[1963]] Kennedy visited [[West Berlin]] and gave a public speech criticizing communism. While Kennedy was speaking, some people on the other side of the wall in [[East Berlin]] were applauding Kennedy and showing their distaste for [[Soviet]] control. Kennedy used the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] as an example of the failures of communism  &quot;[[Freedom]] has many difficulties and [[democracy]] is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in.&quot; The speech is known for its famous phrase ''&quot;[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]&quot;''.

Troubled by the long-term dangers of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]], Kennedy also pushed for the adoption of a Limited or [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but does not prohibit testing underground. The United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to the Treaty. Kennedy signed the Treaty into law in August 1963, and believed it to be one of the greatest accomplishments of his administration.		
 		
On the occasion of his visit to [[Ireland]] in 1963, President Kennedy joined with Irish President [[Eamon de Valera]] to form The [[American Irish Foundation]]. The mission of this organization was to foster connections between Americans of Irish descent and the country of their ancestry. Kennedy furthered these connections of cultural solidarity by accepting a grant of [[armorial bearings]] from the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. {{see|The Ireland Funds}}

===Domestic policies===		
[[Image:JFKMLK.jpg|thumb|left|200px|JFK in the [[Oval Office]] with various civil rights activists including [[Martin Luther King Jr]]]]		
Kennedy used the term [[New Frontier]] as a label for his domestic programs. It ambitiously promised federal funding for [[education]], [[health care]] for the [[Old age|elderly]], and government intervention to halt the [[recession]]. Kennedy also promised an end to [[racial discrimination]].		
 		
The turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of Kennedy's era. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled in 1954 that [[racial segregation]] in public schools would no longer be permitted. However, there were many schools, especially in southern states, that did not obey this decision. There also remained the practice of segregation on buses, in restaurants, movie theaters, and other public places.		
 		
Kennedy started his fight for civil rights when he appealed to African-American voters during his campaign in 1962. 		
 		
In 1962, [[James Meredith]] tried to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]], but he was prevented by white students. Kennedy responded by sending some 400 federal marshals and 3000 troops to ensure that Meredith could enroll in his first class.		
 		
Kennedy also assigned [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshals]] to protect the [[Freedom Riders]].		
 		
Thousands of Americans of all races and backgrounds joined Kennedy in protesting racial discrimination. Kennedy supported [[racial integration]] and civil rights, and during the 1960 campaign he telephoned [[Coretta Scott King]], wife of the jailed Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], which drew much black support to his candidacy. However, as president, Kennedy initially believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many Southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through Congress, which was dominated by Southern Democrats, and he distanced himself from it. As a result, many civil rights leaders viewed Kennedy as unsupportive of their efforts. 	It is also notable that Kennedy approved warrantless wiretaps and covert surveillance of King and other civil rights leaders.

On [[June 11]], President Kennedy intervened when the Governor of Alabama, [[George Wallace]], blocked the doorway to the [[University of Alabama]] to stop two black students, [[Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]], from enrolling. George Wallace moved aside after being confronted by [[federal marshals]], Deputy Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], and the Alabama [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. That evening Kennedy gave his famous Civil Rights Address on national television and radio, applying the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|golden rule]] to U.S. race relations.[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/johnfkennedycivilrights.htm] Kennedy proposed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].		
[http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/statues/jfk_landing.htm]		
[http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/39.htm]		
 		
Also on the domestic front, in 1963 Kennedy proposed a [[tax reform]] that included income [[tax cuts]], but this was not passed by the Congress until after his death in 1964. It is one of the largest tax cuts in modern U.S. history, surpassing the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] tax cut of 1981.

===Support of space programs===		
[[Image:JFKNASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|JFK looks at the spacecraft [[Mercury Atlas 6|Friendship 7]], the spacecraft that made three earth orbits, piloted by astronaut [[John Glenn]].]]		
Kennedy was eager for the United States to lead the way in the [[space race]]. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] has said that JFK approached his father twice for a 'joint venture' in space exploration  in June 1961 and Autumn 1963. On the first occasion Russia was far ahead of America, and Khrushchev then said 'nyet' (&quot;no&quot;). Kennedy later made a speech at [[Rice University]] in September 1962, in which he said, &quot;no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space&quot; and &quot;we choose to go to the [[Moon]] in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.&quot;[http://webcast.rice.edu/speeches/19620912kennedy.html]. On the second approach to Khrushchev, the Soviet premier was persuaded that cost sharing was beneficial, and American space technology was forging ahead - the U.S. had launched a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite, and Kennedy had asked Congress to approve more than 22 billion dollars for [[Project Apollo]], which had the goal of landing an American man on the Moon before the end of the decade. Khrushchev agreed to a joint venture in Autumn 1963, but JFK died in November before the agreement could be formalised. 		
In 1969, six years after Kennedy's death, the Project Apollo goal was finally realized when [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] became the first humans to [[Moon Landing|land on the Moon]].

===Assassination and aftermath===		
[[Image:JFKmotorcade.jpg|thumb|right|President Kennedy, Jackie, and Gov. [[John Connally]] in the Presidential limousine shortly before the assassination.]]		
{{main|John F. Kennedy assassination}}		
President Kennedy was assassinated in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] on Friday, [[November 22]], [[1963]] at 12:30 pm [[CST]] while on a political trip through Texas. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was charged at 7:00 pm for killing Dallas policeman, J.D. Tippit, by &quot;murder with malice&quot;, and also charged at 11:30 pm for the murder of the president (there being no charge of &quot;assassination&quot; of a president at that time). Oswald was fatally shot less than two days later in Dallas police station by [[Jack Ruby]]. Five days after Oswald was killed, the new president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], created the [[Warren Commission]], chaired by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], to investigate the assassination. It concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. A later investigation in the 1970s by the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) also concluded that Oswald was the assassin, however, it added that he was likely part of a [[conspiracy]] to kill the president, although the committee did not uncover sufficient evidence to identify any other members of the conspiracy. 		
 		
Critics have proposed a number of [[Kennedy assassination theories]] which contradict the various theories on exactly how the assassination took place that have been proposed by the government's official reports. There is no consensus among government investigations, let alone amongst their critics, on the number of bullets fired at the president, the direction from which all the bullets were fired, and which of the bullets struck the president, and [[List of Governors of Texas|Governor]] [[John Connally]], who was also wounded in the attack.		
 		
[[Lee Harvey Oswald]] denied shooting anyone, and claimed he was being set up as a &quot;[[patsy]]&quot;. He claimed the photograph of him holding the alleged murder weapon was a fabrication, and that he would prove his face was pasted on the body of someone else holding the rifle. However, because of his own murder by [[Jack Ruby]], Oswald's guilt or innocence was never determined in a court of law. Some critics contend that Oswald was not involved at all and that he was framed.

Among the most widely posited conspirators in the assassination are the [[CIA]], the [[mafia]], the [[KGB]], and [[Fidel Castro]], Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and the military-industrial complex.

==Image, social life and family==		
{{see|Kennedy political family}}		
Both Kennedy and his wife &quot;Jackie&quot; were very young in comparison to earlier presidents and first ladies, and were both extraordinarily popular in ways more common to [[pop singer]]s and [[movie star]]s than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines.		
 		
[[Image:Kennedy bros.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Kennedy brothers during the 1960 campaign: John, Robert, and Edward (Ted)]]		
The Kennedys brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the [[White House]]. They believed that the White House should be a place to celebrate American history, culture, and achievement, and invited artists, writers, scientists, poets, musicians, actors, [[Nobel Prize]] winners and athletes to visit. [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] also gathered new [[art]] and [[furniture]] and eventually restored all the rooms in the White House.		
The White House also seemed like a more fun, youthful place, because of the Kennedys' two young children, [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]] and [[John F. Kennedy Jr.|John Jr.]] (who came to be known in the popular press as &quot;John-John&quot; though years later Jacqueline Kennedy denied that the family called him by that name). Outside the White House Lawn, the Kennedys established a pre-school, swimming pool, and tree house.		
 		
Behind the glamorous facade, the Kennedys also suffered many personal tragedies. Jacqueline suffered a miscarriage in 1955, and gave birth to a stillborn daughter in 1956. (Although the daughter was unnamed  and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery next to her parents with a marker reading &quot;Daughter&quot; Kennedy  later reports indicated that the Kennedys had intended to call her Arabella.) The death of their newborn son [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]] in August 1963 was a great loss. 		
 		
The charisma of Kennedy and his family led to the figurative designation of &quot;[[Camelot (disambiguation)|Camelot]]&quot; for his administration, credited by his widow to his affection for the contemporary Broadway musical of the same name.

Kennedy is the third most [[Gallup's List of Widely Admired People|admired]] person in the 20th century, according to [[Gallup]].

==Legacy==		
[[Image:JFKCasketLeavesCapitolHill.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The world mourned the assassinated president]]		
 		
[[Television]] became the primary source by which people kept informed of events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination, with newspapers the following day becoming more souvenirs than sources of updated information. U.S. networks switched to 24 hour news coverage for the first time ever. [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy’s state funeral]] and the murder of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] were all broadcast live in America and in other places around the world. It was with this event that television matured as a news source rivaling that of newspapers.		
 		
The assassination had such an impact on every American, most that were alive when first learning of the news that Kennedy was assassinated vividly remember where they were when they received word. U.N. Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson]] said of the assassination that &quot;all of us...will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours.&quot; 		
 		
[[Image:JFK grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.]]		
On [[March 14]], [[1967]] Kennedy's body was moved to a permanent burial place and memorial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Kennedy is buried with his wife and their deceased children, and his brother Robert is also buried nearby. His grave is marked with an &quot;[[John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame|Eternal Flame]].&quot; Kennedy and [[William Howard Taft]] are the only two US Presidents buried at Arlington.		
 		
Many of Kennedy's speeches, especially his inaugural address, are considered to be inspiring and iconic. Despite his relatively short term in office and a lack of major legislative changes during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Selected excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on marble panels at his grave at Arlington.		
 		
==Memorials==		
[[Image:wiki_kennedy.JPG|thumb|left|200px]]		
Kennedy's legacy has been memorialized in various aspects of American culture. To name a few:		
*New York Idlewild International Airport was renamed [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]] on [[December 24]], [[1963]]. Even though the airport was renamed &quot;John F. Kennedy International Airport,&quot; most people refer to it as &quot;JFK.&quot;		
*The ''[[USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)|USS John F. Kennedy]]'' was awarded on [[April 30]], [[1964]] as a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[aircraft carrier]].		
*The [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] opened in 1979 as Kennedy's official [[presidential library]].		
*[[John F. Kennedy University]] opened in [[Pleasant Hill, California]] in 1964 as a school for adult education. 		
*[[John F. Kennedy National Historic Site]] preserves his home in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. 		
*The [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] opened in 1971 in Washington, DC as a living memorial to him.
*A British memorial at [[Runnymede]], England, as well as a memorial bust near Regent's Park in London.
*A memorial on the harbor at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.		
[[Cape Canaveral]] was renamed Cape Kennedy in 1963, but reverted to its original name in 1973.		
 		
Hundreds of schools across the U.S were also renamed in his honor. 	 		
Posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963, Kennedy's portrait now appears on the [[United States half dollar coin]].		
 		
==Criticism==		
[[Image:wanted for treason.jpg|thumb|230px|A famous handbill circulated on November 21, 1963		
In Dallas, Texas. One day before the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].]]		
 		
Kennedy is among the most popular former presidents of the United States; however, a number of critics argue that his reputation is largely undeserved. Although he was young and charismatic, he had little chance to achieve much during his presidency. Under this reasoning, his immense popularity results from the fact that his short time in office was marked by the optimistic beginnings of many programs declared to be of great benefit to the United States, its people, and various global issues. Unlike the tenures of other U.S. presidents, Kennedy's time in office, generally speaking, thereby lacked the scandals and controversies seen in the terms of many other presidents who served longer. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] that he sent to Congress in June of 1963 was, at least in part, conceived by his brother and Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and it was signed into law by his successor, Lyndon Johnson, in 1964.

Kennedy and his vice president Lyndon B. Johnson are primarily blamed for sending the first combat troops into the largely unpopular Vietnam War. Kennedy is also blamed by millions of Cubans for the Bay of Pigs slaughter, in which thousands of Cubans were killed, even after being promised protection from the United States. This promise was broken when Kennedy backed out at the last moment. Many Cuban refugees felt betrayed by the Kennedy adminstration and became Republicans. Many of them served in public office in the state of Florida and in other parts of the nation.

In 2000, The Wall Street Journal joined with the Federalist Society to sponsor a rating of former presidents by a panel of 78 academics, carefully chosen for political balance. The rankings and impressive commentary can be found as &quot;Hail to the Chief.&quot; Going up just in time to be swamped by the Florida election contest, the project has not received the attention it deserves. No fewer than 43 raters, an outright majority of the panel, considered President John F. Kennedy overrated. An essay by Akhil Reed Amar of Yale Law School faults JFK for appeasing Southern Democrats by stocking the lower federal bench with &quot;notorious segregationists&quot;; the best civil rights judges were Eisenhower appointees. And with the appointment of his brother as attorney general, he tried to found a political dynasty, abhorred by the Founding Fathers. &quot;The metaphor of Camelot, after all, is ultimately un-American and undemocratic, conjuring up images of crowns and dashing young princes and noble birth.&quot; 	
 		
Kennedy's personal life has also attracted the ire of critics, some of whom argue that lapses in judgment in his personal life impacted his professional life. Among the critics' charges are: that the Kennedy family concealed from the public his serious, potentially life-threatening health issues (e.g., he suffered from [[Addison's disease]]) and his heavy medication regimen; that he had a long history of extramarital affairs; and that he had alleged, circuitous links to [[organized crime]] figures. Seymour Hersh's ''The Dark Side of Camelot'' (1998) presents such a critical argument. Robert Dallek's ''An Unfinished Life'' (2003) is a more balanced biography, but contains much detail on Kennedy's health issues.		
 		
Another of Kennedy's critics is U.S. intellectual [[Noam Chomsky]], whose book ''Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietnam War, and US Political Culture'' (1993) presents an image of the Kennedy administration opposite to the one that lingers in mainstream memory. The book is a criticism of policy rather than his personal life, and explores information not usually presented about the 35th president. In particular, Chomsky and many other critics highlight the ill-planned increased U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam conflict]] during Kennedy's administration.

==Trivia==
*JFK was the first president born in the 20th century.
		
*Because of his early death at the age of 46, he was outlived by three of his predecessors, [[Herbert Hoover]] (1874-1964), [[Harry S. Truman]] (1884-1972) and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1890-1969), and four of his successors who were actually older than he, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1908-1973), [[Richard Nixon]] (1913-1994), [[Gerald Ford]] (b. 1913) and [[Ronald Reagan]] (1911-2004).

'''James Augustine Aloysius Joyce''' ([[2 February]] [[1882]] &amp;ndash; [[13 January]] [[1941]]) was an [[expatriate]] [[Ireland|Irish]] writer and poet, widely considered to be one of the most influential writers of the [[20th century]].  He is best known for his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' ([[1914]]), and his novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' ([[1916]]), ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' ([[1922]]), and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' ([[1939]]).

Although most of his adult life was spent outside the country, Joyce's Irish experiences are essential to his writings and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of their subject matter. His fictional universe is firmly rooted in [[Dublin]] and reflects his family life and the events and friends (and enemies) from his school and college days. Due to this, he became both one of the most cosmopolitan and one of the most local of all the great [[English language]] [[modernist literature|modernists]].

==Life and writings==
===Dublin, 1882-1904===
In 1882, James Augustine Joyce was born into a [[Catholic]] family in the Dublin [[suburb]] of [[Rathgar]]. He was the eldest of ten surviving children; two of his siblings died of typhoid. His father's family, originally from [[Cork]], once owned a small salt and lime works. Both Joyce's paternal grandfather and his father married into wealthy families. In 1887, his father, [[John Joyce|John Stanislaus Joyce]], was appointed rate collector by [[Dublin Corporation]]; the family subsequently moved to the fashionable new suburb of [[Bray]]. Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, which added them to his lifelong fear of thunderstorms, a fear that had been inspired by his deeply religious aunt as a sign of God's divine wrath.

In [[1891]], James wrote a poem, &quot;Et Tu Healy,&quot; on the death of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. His father had it printed and even sent a copy to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in ''[[Stubbs Gazette]]'' (an official register of [[bankrupt|bankruptcies]]) and suspended from work. In 1893 John Joyce was dismissed with a [[pension]]. This was the beginning of a slide into [[poverty]] for the family, mainly due to John's drinking and general financial mismanagement.

James Joyce was initially educated at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a boarding school in [[County Kildare]], which he entered in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[Christian Brothers]] school on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the [[Jesuits]]' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. The offer was made at least partly in the hope that he would prove to have a vocation and join the Order. Joyce, however, would reject [[Catholicism]] by the age of 16, although the philosophy of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] would remain a strong influence on him throughout his life.

He enrolled at the recently established [[University College Dublin]] in 1898, as [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] was still off-limits to Catholics. He studied modern languages, specifically [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].  He also became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. His review of ''[[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s New Drama'' was published in 1900 and resulted in a letter of thanks from the [[Norway|Norwegian]] dramatist himself. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College would appear as characters in Joyce's written works.

After graduating from UCD in 1903, Joyce left for Paris; ostensibly to study medicine, but in reality he squandered money his family could ill afford. He returned to Ireland after a few months, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer. Joyce refused to pray at her bedside but this seems to have had more to do with Joyce's agnosticism than antagonism for his mother. After she died he continued to drink heavily, and conditions at home grew quite appalling. He scraped a living reviewing books, teaching and singing. On [[7 January]] [[1904]], he wrote ''A Portrait of the Artist'', an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, in a day, only to have it rejected from the free-thinking magazine ''Dana''. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story and turn it into a novel he planned to call ''Stephen Hero''.  The same year he met [[Nora Barnacle]], a young woman from [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]] who was working as a chambermaid. On [[16 June]] [[1904]], they went on their first date, an event which would be commemorated by providing the date for the action of ''Ulysses''. Joyce remained in Dublin for some time longer, drinking heavily. After one of these drinking binges, he got into an fight over a misunderstanding with a man in [[Phoenix Park]]; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father's, Alfred H. Hunter, who brought him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter was rumored to be a [[Jew]] and to have an unfaithful wife, and would serve as one of the models for [[Leopold Bloom]], the main protagonist of ''Ulysses''. He took up with medical student [[Oliver St John Gogarty]], who formed the basis for the character Buck Mulligan in ''Ulysses''. After staying in Gogarty's [[Martello Tower]] for six nights he left in the middle of the night following an altercation which involved Gogarty shooting a pistol in his direction. He walked all the way back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk. Shortly thereafter he eloped to the continent with Nora.

Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile, moving first to [[Zurich]], where he had supposedly acquired a post teaching English at the [[Berlitz Language Schools|Berlitz Language School]] through an agent in England. It turned out that the English agent had been swindled, but the director of the school sent him on to [[Trieste]], in [[Austria-Hungary]]. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz school, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there from October 1904 through March 1905, when the Austrians discovered an espionage ring in the city and expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English. He would remain in Trieste for most of the next ten years.

Later that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George. He then managed to talk his brother, [[Stanislaus Joyce|Stanislaus]], into joining him in Trieste, and secured him a position teaching at the school. Ostensibly his reasons were for his company and offering his brother a much more interesting life than the simple clerking job he had back in Dublin, but in truth, he hoped to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings. Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations the entire time they lived together in Trieste, most arguments centering around Joyce's frivolity with money and drinking habits.

With chronic wanderlust much of his early life, Joyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to [[Rome]] in late 1906, having secured a position working in a bank in the city. He intensely disliked Rome, however, and ended up moving back to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] was born in the summer of the same year.

Joyce returned to Dublin in the summer of 1909 with George, in order to visit his father, show off his son and work on getting ''Dubliners'' published. He visited Nora's family in [[Galway]], meeting them for the first time (a successful visit, to his relief). When preparing to return to Trieste he decided to bring one of his sisters, Eva, back to Trieste with him in order to help Nora look after the home. He would spend only a month back in Trieste before again heading back to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners in order to set up a regular cinema in Dublin. The venture was successful (but would quickly fall apart in his absence), and he returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister in tow, Eileen. While Eva became very homesick for Dublin and returned a few years later, Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.

Joyce returned to Dublin briefly in the summer of 1912 during his years-long fight with his Dublin publisher, George Roberts, over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem &quot;Gas from a Burner&quot; as a thinly veiled invective of Roberts. It was his last trip to Ireland, and he never came closer to Dublin than London again, despite the many pleas of his father and invitations from fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].

Joyce came up with many money-making schemes during this period of his life, such as his attempt to become a cinema magnate back in Dublin, as well as an always-discussed but never-accomplished plan to import Irish tweeds into Trieste. His expert borrowing skills kept him from ever becoming completely destitute. His income was made up partially from his position at the Berlitz school, and partially from taking on private students. Many of his aquaintances through meeting these private students proved invaluable allies during his problems getting out of Austria-Hungary and into [[Switzerland]] in 1915.

One of his students in Trieste was [[Italo Svevo|Ettore Schmitz]], better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]; they met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Jew, and became the primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the Jewish faith included in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz in response to Joyce's queries. Joyce would spend most of the rest of his life on the Continent. It was in Trieste that he first began to be plagued by major eye problems, which would result in over a dozen surgeries before his death.

In 1915 he moved to Zurich in order to avoid the complexities of living in Austria-Hungary during [[World War I]], where he met one of his most enduring and important friends, Frank Budgen, whose opinion Joyce constantly sought through the writing of ''Ulysses'' and ''Finnegans Wake''. It was also here where [[Ezra Pound]] brought him to the attention of English feminist and publisher [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], who would become Joyce's patron, providing him thousands of pounds over the next 25 years and relieving him of the burden of teaching in order to focus on his writing. After the war he returned to Trieste briefly, but found the city had changed, and his relations with his brother (who had been interred in an Austrian prison camp for most of the war due to his pro-Italian politics) were more strained than ever. Joyce headed to Paris in 1920 at an invitation from Ezra Pound, supposedly for a week, but he ended up living there for the next twenty years.

===1920-1941: Paris and Zurich===
He travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and treatments for Lucia, who suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. In Paris, [[Maria Jolas|Maria]] and [[Eugene Jolas]] nursed Joyce during his long years of writing ''Finnegans Wake''. Were it not for their unwavering support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's unwavering financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their now legendary literary magazine ''&quot;transition'',&quot;  the Jolases published serially various sections of Joyce's novel under the title ''Work in Progress.'' He returned to Zurich to live after the [[Nazi]] occupation of [[France]] in [[1939]]. He lived quietly in Zurich for the next two years. On [[11 January]] [[1941]], he underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer. While at first improved, he relapsed the following day, and despite several transfusions, fell into a coma. He awoke at 2 a.m. on [[13 January]] [[1941]], and asked for a nurse to call his wife and son before losing consciousness again. They were still en route when he expired fifteen minutes later. He is buried in the [[Fluntern Cemetery]] within earshot of the lions in the Zurich zoo. His wife Nora, (whom he finally married in London in 1931) survived him by 10 years.  She is buried now by his side, as is their son George, who passed away in 1976.

'''Dubliners'''

Joyce's Irish experiences are essential to his writings, and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of their subject matter. The early volume of short stories, ''[[Dubliners]]'', is a penetrating analysis of the stagnation and paralysis of Dublin society. The stories incorporate [[Epiphany|epiphanies]], a word used particularly by Joyce, by which he meant a sudden consciousness of the &quot;soul&quot; of a thing. Although many of Joyce's works illustrate the rich tradition of the [[Catholic Church]], his short story &quot;Araby&quot; displays his disaffection and loss of faith with the Church. The final and most famous story in the collection, &quot;[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]&quot;, was directed by [[John Huston]] as his last feature film, completed in 1987.

'''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'''

''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned ''Stephen Hero'' novel, the original manuscript of which was partially destroyed in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora.  A künstlerroman, or story of the development of an artist (a type of  [[bildungsroman]], or coming of age novel), it is largely autobiographical, showing the process of attaining maturity and self-consciousness by a gifted young man. The main character is [[Stephen Dedalus]], Joyce's representation of himself. In this novel, some glimpses of Joyce's later techniques are evident, in the use of interior monologue and in the concern with the psychic rather than external reality. [[Joseph Strick]] directed a film of the book in 1977 starring [[Luke Johnston]], [[Bosco Hogan]], [[T.P. McKenna]] and [[John Gielgud]].

'''Exiles and poetry'''

Despite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''Exiles'', begun shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in [[1914]] and published in 1918. A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which was begun around the time of the play's composition.

Joyce also published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside &quot;The Holy Office&quot; ([[1904]]), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection ''Chamber Music'' (named after the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot) consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. The other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime consists of &quot;Gas From A Burner&quot; ([[1912]]), ''Pomes Penyeach'' ([[1927]]) and &quot;Ecce Puer&quot;, written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father. It was published in ''Collected Poems'' ([[1936]]).

'''Ulysses'''

In 1906, as he was completing work on ''Dubliners'', Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. The story was not written, but the idea stayed with Joyce and, in 1914, he started work on a novel using both the title and basic premise, completing the writing in October, 1921. It was to be another three months before Joyce would stop working on the [[proofreading|proofs]] of the book; he halted on the cusp of his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday ([[2 February]] [[1922]]).

Thanks to [[Ezra Pound]], serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a [[New York]] [[attorney]] with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature. Unfortunately, this serialisation ran into censorship problems in the [[United States]], and in 1920 the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity, resulting in an end to the serial publication of the novel. The novel remained banned in the States until 1933.

At least partly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Left Bank]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company]]''. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of 'bootleg' versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.

[[1922]] was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism, with the appearance of both ''Ulysses''  and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]''. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, [[16 June]] [[1904]], sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of [[Thom's Directory]]&amp;mdash; a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every
residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.

The book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8 a.m. and ending sometime after 2 a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of [[20th century]] modernist literature. The use of [[classical mythology]] as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others.  Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, &quot;I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',&quot; and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.

Joseph Strick directed a [[Ulysses (film)|film]] of the book in 1967 starring [[Milo O'Shea]], [[Barbara Jefford]] and [[Maurice Roëves]]. [[Sean Walsh]] directed another version released in 2004 starring [[Stephen Rea]], [[Angeline Ball]] and [[Hugh O'Conor]].

'''Finnegans Wake'''

Having completed work on ''Ulysses'', Joyce felt he had completed his life's work but soon was at work on an even more ambitious work. On [[10 March]] [[1923]] he began work on a text that was to be known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. By 1926 he had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the [[1930s]], progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego (this is one example of Joyce's numerous superstitions).

Reaction to the early sections that appeared in ''transition'' was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother [[Stanislaus Joyce]]. In order to counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 47th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on [[4 May]] [[1939]].

Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure language, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in &quot;[[Jabberwocky]]&quot;. If ''Ulysses'' is a day in the life of a city, the ''Wake'' is a night and partakes of the logic of dreams.  This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the Wake of ''Ulysses''  as his ''usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles'' to the Wake itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.

Much of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.

The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the &quot;characters&quot;. Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos.  The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing sentences of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.' (with a pun on Vico in 'vicus') and ends 'A way a lone a last a loved a long the'. In other words, the first sentence starts on the last page and the last sentence on the first, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from ''ideal insomnia'' and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.

==Joyce's legacy==
[[Image:Ireland - Dublin - St Stephen's Green - James Joyce.jpg|A bust of James Joyce in St. Stephen's Green in Dublin|thumb]]

Joyce's work has been subject to intense scrutiny by scholars of all types. He has also been an important influence on writers as diverse as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Flann O'Brien]], [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[William Burroughs]].

Joyce's influence is also evident in fields other than literature. The phrase &quot;Three Quarks for Muster Mark&quot; in Joyce's ''Finnegans Wake'' is often called the source of the physicists' word &quot;[[quark]]&quot;, the name of one of the main kinds of [[elementary particle]]s, proposed by the physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]].  ([[James Gleick]]'s book ''Genius'' notes that Gell-Mann may have found the Joycean antecedent after the fact; as Gleick observes, physicists have pronounced ''quark'' to rhyme with ''cork'' and not with ''Mark.'' It may be noted, however, against Gleick's speculation, that the discoverers of quarks were Americans who would have pronounced quark in the American, not the Irish accent.)  The French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] has written a book on the use of language in ''Ulysses'', and the American philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] has written similarly on ''Finnegans Wake'' in comparison with [[Lewis Carroll]].  [[Vladimir Nabokov]] esteemed ''Ulysses'' greatly, listing it with [[Franz Kafka]]'s &quot;[[The Metamorphosis]]&quot; as one of the [[20th century]]'s greatest prose works.  However, Nabokov was less than thrilled with ''Finnegans Wake'' (see ''[[Strong Opinions]],'' ''[[Lolita|The Annotated Lolita]]'' or ''[[Pale Fire]]''), an attitude which [[Jorge Luis Borges]] shared.

''Finnegans Wake'' is a recurring theme in [[Tom Robbins]]'s novel ''[[Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates]].''  In that novel, it is the favourite discussion topic of the [[Bangkok]]-based &quot;C.R.A.F.T. Club&quot; (Can't Remember A Fucking Thing).  The protagonist, a [[CIA]] agent named Switters, contemplates writing a thesis about it. The life of Joyce is celebrated annually on June 16, [[Bloomsday]], in [[Dublin]] and in an increasing number of cities worldwide.

'''Judo''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 柔道, ''jūdō''; &quot;gentle way&quot;) is a [[martial art]], [[sport]], and [[philosophy]] originated in [[Japan]].  Judo was developed from [[Jujutsu]], and was founded by Dr. [[Jigoro Kano]] (嘉納治五郎) in [[1882]]. The sport became the model of the modern Japanese martial arts, [[gendai budo]], developed from old [[koryu]] schools.  Practitioners of Judo are called '''judoka''' (柔道家).

==History and philosophy==
The early history of Judo and that of its founder, Japanese [[polymath]] and educator [[Jigoro Kano|Kano Jigoro]] (surname first in [[Japanese name|Japanese]]) (1860-1938), are inseparable.  Kano was born into a well-to-do Japanese family.  His grandfather was a self-made man, a [[sake]] brewer from [[Shiga prefecture]] in central Japan; however, Kano's father was not the eldest son and did not inherit the business, but instead became a Shinto priest and government official, with enough influence for his son to enter the second incoming class of [[Tokyo Imperial University]].

Kano was a small, frail boy, who, even in his twenties, did not weigh more than a hundred pounds, was often picked on by bullies. He first started pursuing [[jujitsu]] (柔術), at that time a flourishing art, at the age of 17, but met with little success---in part due to difficulties finding a teacher who would take him on as a serious student. When he went off to the University to study literature at the age of 18, he continued his martial efforts, eventually gaining a referral to [[Hachinosuke Fukuda]], a master of the [[Tenjin Shinyo Ryu]] (天神真楊流) and ancestor of noted Japanese/American judoka [[Keiko Fukuda]], who is one of Kano's oldest surviving students. Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds of Kano's emphasis of [[randori]] (乱取り), or free practice, in Judo.

Little more than a year after Kano joined Fukuda's school, Fukuda took ill and died.  Kano then became a student in another Tenjin Shinyo school, that of [[Masatomo Iso]], who put more emphasis on formal [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]] than did Fukuda.  Through dedication, Kano quickly earned the title &quot;[[shihan]]&quot;, or master, and became assistant instructor to Iso at the age of 21.  Iso, too, took ill, and Kano, feeling that he still had much to learn, took up another style, becoming a student of [[Tsunetoshi Iikubo]] of [[Kito Ryu]].  Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on free practice; on the other hand, Kito Ryu emphasized throwing techniques to a much greater degree than Tenjin Shinyo Ryu.

By this time, Kano was devising new techniques, such as the ''kata guruma'' ( or 'shoulder wheel', known as a fireman's carry to Western wrestlers who use(d) a slightly different form of this technique) and ''uki goshi'' (floating hip toss). His thoughts were already on doing more than expanding the canons of Kito and Tenjin Shinyo Ryu;  full of new ideas, in part as a result of his education, Kano had in mind a major reformation of jujutsu, with techniques based on sound scientific principles, and with focus on development of the body, mind, and character of young men in addition to development of martial prowess. At the age of 22, just about to finish his degree at the University, Kano took 9 students from Iikubo's school to study jujitsu under him at the [[Eishoji Temple]]. Although two years would pass before it would be called by that name, and Kano had not yet been accorded the title of &quot;master&quot; in the Kito ryu (起倒流) -- Iikubo would come to the temple to help teach three days per week, this was the founding of the [[Kodokan Institute|Kodokan]] (講道館) or &quot;place for learning the way.&quot;

&lt;!--to be continued--&gt;
The word Judo is composed of two kanji:  &quot;ju&quot; (柔), which means gentleness, and &quot;dō&quot; (道), way or road(the same character as the Chinese &quot;[[tao]]&quot;).  Thus Judo literally means &quot;the gentle way&quot;, or &quot;the way of giving way&quot;, and may also be defined as &quot;the way of suppleness&quot;, &quot;the way of flexibility, or &quot;the way of adaptability&quot;.  To English speakers, Judo and Jujutsu would mean &quot;the easy way&quot;, as in the easiest way to accomplish something. Judo takes from jujutsu (&quot;gentle art&quot;) the principle of using one's opponent's strength against him and adapting well to changing circumstances.  For example, if the attacker was to push against his opponent he would find his opponent stepping to the side and allowing (usually with the aid of a foot to trip him up) his momentum to throw him forwards (the inverse being true for pulling). Kano saw jujutsu as a disconnected bag of tricks, and sought to unify it according to some principle; he found it in the notion of &quot;maximum efficiency&quot;. Jujitsu techniques which relied solely on superior strength were discarded or adapted in favour of those which involved redirecting the opponent's force, off-balancing the opponent, or making use of superior leverage.

== Judo's Theory of Combat ==
Judo assumes that there are two main phases of combat: the standing (''[[grappling#Stand-up grappling|tachi-waza]]'') and the ground (''[[grappling#Ground grappling|ne-waza]]'') phase.  Each phase requires its own mostly separate techniques, strategies, [[randori]], conditioning and so on, although some special training is devoted to 'transitional' techniques to bridge the gap.  Some [[judoka]] can become quite skilled in one phase and be rather weak in the other, depending on where their interests most lie, although most are rather balanced between the two.

'''The Standing Phase'''

In the standing phase, which is considered the initial phase, the opponents try to throw each other to the ground.  Even though standing joint-lock and choke/strangulation submission techniques are legal in the standing phase, they are quite rare due to the fact that they are much harder to apply standing than throws are.  Some judoka, however, are very skilled in combining takedowns with submissions, where a submission technique is begun standing and finished on the ground.  Strikes (i.e. punches, kicks etc) are not allowed due to their certainty of injury, but judoka are supposed to 'take them into consideration' while training by, for example, not fighting in a bent-over position for long, since this position is vulnerable to knee-strikes and others.  The main purpose of the throwing techniques ([[nage waza]]) is to take an opponent who is standing on his feet, mobile and dangerous, down onto his back where he cannot move any more.  Thus, the main reason for throwing the opponent is to control him and put yourself in a dominant position above him where you have more potential to inflict damage on him than he does on you.  Be that as it may, another reason to throw the opponent is to shock his body through smashing him forcefully onto the ground.  If a judoka executes a powerful yet fully controlled throw, he can win a match outright due to the theory that he has displayed enough superiority.  In actual fact, this kind of victory is very difficult to achieve if the opponents are equally matched.  Therefore points are given for lesser throws in the standing phase of combat. In real fight situations, a throw in itself can create shock to the opponent, and the impact can potentially knock the opponent unconscious (depending on the hardness of the ground).

'''The Ground Phase'''

In the ground phase, which is considered the secondary phase of combat, the opponents try to hold, or get the opponent to submit either by using arm locks (leg locks are not allowed due to safety regulations) or by chokes and strangulations.

'''Footsweeps'''

Footsweeps are used to off-balance the opponent.

'''Pins'''

Pins are considered important since in a real fight the person on top who has control of the person beneath can hit him with knees, forearms, the head and so on.  If a pin is held for 25 seconds, the person doing the pinning wins the match.  The reason for requiring such a long pin is that in order to be able to hit the person underneath you effectively, you have to have full control of him for a long time.  In a match, if you pin your opponent for less than 25 seconds you get points depending on how long, with the minimum being 10 seconds.  This also flows from the theory that you will be striking a pinned opponent, and after 10 seconds will have possibly weakened him somewhat with strikes, at least enough to merit giving some points.

However, if the person you are holding down has wrapped his legs around any part of your lower body or your trunk, he is pinning you as much as you are pinning him since you cannot get up and flee unless he lets go.  What if, for example, his friends who are nearby happen to drop in to 'pay you a little visit'?  You won't be able to get away.  Also, to make things even worse for you,  there are various attacking techniques he can launch against you from this position, which is called '[[Dojime]]' (body squeeze) in Japanese and '[[Guard (grappling)|The Guard]]' in English.  Clearly you do not have control of him in this position even though you are 'on top', so it is not considered a pin.  It is your job to break through his 'guard' and pin or submit him, and it is his job to submit you from where he is, to roll you over and get on top of you or to simply break out and get back up to his feet and fight from there if that is what he wants to do.

'''Joint Locks'''

Elbow locks are considered safe-enough to do at nearly full-force to induce a submission.  In times past, Judo allowed many other joints to be attacked too such as the knees, spine and others.  Over the years it was discovered that attacking those other joints would not only result in many injuries to the athletes, but also would gradually wear the joints down over time.  Even so, some Judoka still enjoy learning and fighting each other informally using these banned techniques.  Joint locks are effective combat techniques since they enable you to control your opponent through pain-compliance.  Also, some joints, such the elbows, can be broken, maiming your adversary so he cannot any longer attack you effectively or put up a defence.  For these reasons Judo considers joint locks to be important techniques.

'''Chokes/Strangulations'''

Chokes/strangulations are Judo's deadliest techniques.  They enable the one applying the choke to force the adversary into unconsciousness and even death. In competition the judoka wins the round if the opponent gives in to submission and/or fail to get out of the hold for 25 seconds.

'''Fighting'''

Judo emphasizes fighting ([[randori]]) as its main form of training.  Half the combat time is spent fighting on the ground, called ''[[grappling#Ground grappling|ne-waza]]'' and the other half standing up, called ''[[grappling#Ground grappling|tachi-waza]]''.  Actual fighting, albeit within safety rules, is considered to be much more effective than only practicing techniques, since fighting full-strength develops the muscles and [[cardio-vascular]] system on the physical side of things, and it develops strategy and reaction time on the mental side of things.

'''Judo's Balanced Approach to Fighting'''

Judo's balance between both the standing and ground phases of combat gives judoka the ability to take down opponents who are standing up and then pin and submit them on the ground.  This balanced theory of combat has made Judo a popular choice for many.

== Uniform ==
[[Image:Judo orange belt.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[judogi]] is intended to withstand the stresses of throwing and grappling]]

'''Judoka''' (Judo practitioners) wear white cotton uniforms called  '''[[Judogi]]''' (which means Judo uniform in Japanese) for practicing Judo.  Sometimes the word is seen shortened simply to &quot;gi&quot; (uniform).  This judogi was created at the [[Kodokan]] and similar uniforms were later adopted by many other martial arts. The judogi consists of white cotton drawstring pants and a white quilted cotton jacket fastened by a colored belt indicative of kyu or dan rank.  The jacket is intended to withstand the stresses of throwing and grappling, and is as a result much thicker than that of a karategi. Before competition, a blue judogi is assigned to one judoka for ease of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators.  In Japan, the traditional red sash (based on the flag's colors) is affixed to one judoka's belt, however in Europe and North America, a colored sash is typically used for convienence in local competitions, while a blue judogi is assigned to one judoka at the regional, national, or Olympic levels where the visibility, particularly to television cameras is more important than tradition or convienence.  It should be noted that Japanese practitioners and purists tend to look down on the use of blue judogis.

==Techniques==
[[Image:Judo_-_Ippon_Seoinage.gif|thumb|One of the first throws learned in judo - the Ippon Seoi Nage]]
While Judo includes a variety of rolls, falls, throws, pins, [[chokehold|chokes]], [[joint-lock]]s, and methods of percussion, the primary focus  is on throwing (''nage-waza'', 投げ技), and groundwork  (''[[grappling#Ground grappling|ne-waza]]'',寝技). Nage-waza is divided in two groups of techniques, standing techniques (''[[grappling#Stand-up grappling|tachi-waza]]'', 立技) and sacrifice techniques (''sutemi-waza'', 捨身技). Standing techniques are divided in hand techniques (''te-waza'', 手技), hip techniques (''koshi-waza'', 腰技) and foot/leg techniques (''ashi-waza'', 足技). Sacrifice techniques are divided into those in which the thrower falls directly backwards (''ma-sutemi-waza'', 真捨身技) and those in which he falls onto his side (''yoko-sutemi-waza'', 橫捨身技).

The groundwork techniques are divided into: attacks against the joints or [[joint lock]]s (''kansetsu-waza'', 関節技), strangleholds or [[chokehold]]s (''shime-waza'', 絞技), and holding or pinning techniques (''osaekomi-waza'', 押込技).

A kind of sparring is practiced in judo, known as ''[[randori]]'' (乱取り), meaning &quot;free practice&quot;.  In randori, players (known as ''judoka'') may attack each other with any judo throw or grappling technique.  Striking techniques (called ''atemi-waza'') such as kicking and punching, along with knife and sword techniques are retained in the ''kata''s taught to higher ranking judoka (for instance, in the [[kime-no-kata]]), but are forbidden in contest (and usually prohibited in randori), for reasons of safety. Also for reasons of safety, chokeholds, jointlocking - and the sacrifice (sutemi) techniques, which can be very spectacular, are often subject to age and/or rank restrictions; in the United States, one must be 13 or older to use chokeholds, and 17 or older, or hold the rank of Shodan (first grade black belt) or higher to use [[armlock]]s.

In ''randori'' and ''shiai'' (tournament) practice, when an opponent successfully executes a chokehold or joint lock, one &quot;taps out&quot; by tapping the mat or one's opponent at least twice in a manner that clearly indicates the submission. When this occurs, the match is over, and the tapping player has lost, but the chokehold or joint lock ceases. Because this allows a merciful exit to the match, injuries related to these holds are quite rare.

Judoka are ranked according to skill and knowledge of judo, that grade being reflected in the colour of his belt: There are two divisions of grades, the student grades (''kyu'', 級), and the master grades (''dan'', 段). In some countries, the nine colours run from grey through white, light blue, blue, yellow, orange, green, purple, and brown. In the UK and most of Europe the belt grading colours run like this: White, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, Brown and then Black. Some European countries additionally use a red belt to signify a complete beginner. In Japan, all adult kyu grades wear either white or brown belts. All ''dan'' grades may wear the ''[[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]''; sixth- through eighth- ''dan''s may alternately wear a red-and-white belt, while those ranked ninth- ''dan'' and above may wear a solid red belt. Historically, a woman's belt had a white stripe at its centre in some countries, while in most of them this custom has been discontinued. Jigoro Kano was the inventor of the ''kyu'' - ''dan'' grading system, that soon got adapted by other martial arts such as [[karate]].

In competition one judoka wears a blue suit while the other wears white.  In some competitions the older system whereby one competitor wears a white sash and the other a blue sash remains in place. In both cases this does not indicate their rank, but is to enable the judges and spectators to tell the opponents apart during a fight. Points are also awarded to white or blue. Corner judges on the corners of the mat also have a white and blue flag to indicate to which competitor a point should go when it is unclear whom it should be awarded to.

In most Western countries, Judokas have to pass an exam which is normally assesed by the Sensei (Teacher) within the '''Dojo'''. Judokas also have to compete in a grading competition against people of a similar grade. Once both parts have been completed it is possible for a Judoka to be promoted. The ''dan'' (black belt) ranks are awarded after doing an exam supervised by independent judges of the national judo association. However, some have been awarded black belts outside of this association. Examples include, Hori Akioya from Bogoto, Colombia, who was awarded a black belt after his death in a Judo match, and student prodigy Joseph Picthall from the United States who was awarded a black belt after defeating a renowned Grand Master in a tournament held in Seattle, Washington in 2000.

==Styles==
Jigoro Kano's [[Kodokan Judo]] (講道館) is not the only style of judo. Kano took the name Judo from Jikishin Ryu Judo, which is an older school but not really seen outside of Japan. A sub-style of Kodokan Judo that developed in Japanese inter-scholastic competition is known as [[Kosen judo]] (高專柔道) with the same range of techniques but greater latitude permitted for ''[[grappling#Ground grappling|Ne-waza]]'' (ground technique).

Teaching in France, Mikonosuke Kawaishi developed an alternative approach to instruction that continued to teach many techniques banned in modern competition.  In Austria, Julius Fleck and others developed a system of throwing intended to extend Judo that they called [[Judo-do]].

Mitsuo 'Count' Maeda introduced Judo to Brazil in the early 20th Century.  At this time, groundfighting ([[newaza]]) was very popular and not yet limited by the rules.  He taught Judo to Carlos Gracie (1902-94) and others in Brazil.  The terms Judo and Jiu-jitsu were at that time interchangeable.  [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] remained rather aloof to later changes in international Judo rules which added emphasis to the standing phase of the fight, and thus remains a distinctive form of Judo to this day.

==Sport==
[[Image:Vladimir Putin martial arts.jpg|thumb|200px|Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] throwing a sparring partner at a training session in [[Novo-Ogaryovo]], [[16 June]] [[2002]]]]

Although a fully featured martial art, judo has also developed as a sport. Judo became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport for men in [[1964]] and, with the persistence of an American woman by the name of [[Rusty Kanokogi]] and many others, a sport for women as well in [[1988]] (both years given were the years that Judo was a demonstration event followed by an official medal event 4 years later). Men and women compete separately (although they often train together), and there are several [[human weight|weight]] divisions.

The seven divisions are:

|-

[[Collegiate]] competition in the [[United States]], especially between [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] and [[San Jose State]], contributed towards refining judo into the sport seen at the [[Olympic Games]] and World Championships.  In the [[1940s]] [[Henry Stone]] and [[Yosh Uchida]], the head coaches at Cal and SJSC, developed a [[weight class]] system for use in the frequent competitions between the schools. In [[1953]], Stone and Uchida successfully petitioned the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] to accept judo as a sport, with their weight class system as an official component.  In [[1961]], Uchida represented the United States at the [[International Judo Federation]] meetings in [[Paris]], where the IJF adopted weight classes for all future championships. Of course the IJF was created largely based on the earlier European Judo Union where weight classes had also been used for many years.

The object in a judo match is to throw your opponent to the ground. This will score an ''ippon'' (一本), a full point that wins the match. Anything else, such as landing your opponent on the hip or shoulder, will be ''waza-ari'' (技有), ''yuko'' (有効) or ''koka'' (効果) (''waza-ari'' being the highest of the 3, ''koka'' the lowest) or even no score. Technically speaking, a ''waza-ari'' is a half-point, two of which will earn the match. ''Yuko''s and ''koka''s are not fractional points in that they do not accumulate to equal a ''waza-ari'' or ''ippon''-- in fact a ''waza-ari'' beats any number of ''yukos'' and a ''yuko'' beats any number of ''kokas''. Rather, they are used as tiebreakers if the match ends before an ''ippon'' is scored. At match end, if one player has scored a ''waza-ari'' and the other has not, the player with the ''waza-ari'' wins, but if they are equal in that regard (both with zero or one) ''yuko''s are used to break the tie. If they are also equal in ''yuko''s, ''koka''s break the tie. Finally, if both players have identical scores, the match is resolved by having the contestants continue fighting in a sudden death overtime called the Golden Score period where the first contestant to get any score wins. If there is no score during this period, then the decision (majority vote) of the referee and two corner judges is used.

After the throw occurs and is scored, combat may continue on the ground. Pinning an opponent, with both shoulders on the mat, for 25 seconds (20 if you previously scored a ''waza-ari'', since two half-points will complete your ippon) results in an ''ippon''. An automatic ''ippon'' is also granted when one's opponent submits (which frequently occurs when strangle holds / arm locks are used). If there is no ''ippon'' or submission, the one with the highest score wins. Penalties may be given for being inactive during the match or using illegal techniques and fighting must be stopped if a participant is outside the designated area on the mat (''[[tatami]]'').

All scores and penalties are given by the referee. The judges can make a decision to change the score or penalty given by the referee.

==Sport and beyond==
Despite the literal meaning of ''judo'' being &quot;the gentle way&quot;, competition judo is one the roughest and most demanding of sports. A World Championship or [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] match lasts only 5 minutes, but will leave participants exhausted.

Without the kicking and punching so common to other martial arts, except in atemi-waza, which is taught to black belts, judo is often portrayed as friendlier than, for instance, [[karate]]. Proponents believe this contributes to judo being underrated as a method of self-defense.  However, while throws executed with proper break falls on soft mats can seem light and graceful, their more practical application on a hard surface (and potentially with greater intent to harm) could be very dangerous.  Even in the controlled environments of a match or dojo training session, injuries can easily occur due to a lapse in focus or overzealous application of a technique.

Due to their knowledge in [[ne-waza]]/[[grappling]] and [[tachi-waza]]/standing-grappling, various accomplished judo practitioners have also competed in [[mixed martial arts]] matches.  [[Hidehiko Yoshida]], an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist in 1992 and World Judo Champion in 1999, is well-known in [[PRIDE|PRIDE Fighting Championships]], as is [[Fedor Emelianenko]], PRIDE's current heavy weight champion.  [[Karo Parisyan]], an Armenian-born judoka now fighting in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], has demonstrated the application of judo techniques to mixed martial arts in the United States. It should be noted that the ability to throw an opponent to his back and apply a pinning technique is of enormous importance in these kinds of competitions, as is the ability to finish off a downed opponent with strikes or a submission-move.  Judo, uniquely among combat sports, puts equal emphasis on the initial throwing and the final pinning and submitting phases of combat, ideally enabling practitioners to dominate grappling-fights from the get-go.

==Organization==
The international organization of judo is the IJF, or the International Judo Federation. In the US, there are several different national organizations. One is USA Judo, which also has state organizations which host state tournaments and other judo related activities.  The other national organizations are USJF, United States Judo Federation, and USJA, United States Judo Association. Each national organization in the US has its own promotion requirements, but they still have the same belt rank system.

In Great Britain, the British Judo Association (BJA) is the largest Judo Association and the only one affiliated to the IJF. Judo clubs can also be administered by the British Judo Council (BJC), which is popular in the north of England. Some minor judo administrations exist, such as the BJC-MAC (British Judo Council - Martial Arts Circle).

[[Image:007.svg|300px|right|thumb|The James Bond 007 gun logo]]
'''James Bond''', also known as '''007''' (pronounced &quot;double-oh seven&quot;), is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[espionage|spy]] created by writer [[Ian Fleming]] in [[1953]]. Fleming wrote numerous novels and short stories based upon the character and, after his death in [[1964]], further literary adventures were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (pseudonym &quot;[[Robert Markham]]&quot;), [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]], and [[Charlie Higson]]; in addition, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] wrote two screenplay novelisations and other authors have also written various unofficial permutations of the character. 

Although initially made famous through the novels, James Bond is now probably best known from the [[EON Productions]] film series. Twenty films have been produced by EON featuring this character as well as two independently produced films and one [[United States|American]] television adaptation of Fleming's first novel under legal licence; however, it is generally considered that only the EON films are &quot;official.&quot; [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] produced most of the official films up until [[1975]] when Broccoli became the sole producer. His daughter, [[Barbara Broccoli]], and his stepson, [[Michael G. Wilson]], carried on the production duties together beginning in [[1995]].

To date, five actors have portrayed Bond in the official series, and a sixth is soon to make his appearance. They are:
*[[Sean Connery]] (1962&amp;ndash;1967; 1971)
*[[George Lazenby]] (1969)
*[[Roger Moore]] (1973&amp;ndash;1985)
*[[Timothy Dalton]] (1987&amp;ndash;1989)
*[[Pierce Brosnan]] (1995&amp;ndash;2002)
*[[Daniel Craig]] (2006&amp;ndash;present)

In addition, [[Barry Nelson]] played Bond in an [[Casino Royale|unofficial TV episode]] in 1954, [[David Niven]] played the role in an [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|unofficial film]] in 1967, and Connery played Bond again in an [[Never Say Never Again|unofficial film]] in 1983.

The twenty-first official film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', with Daniel Craig as Bond, is in production and is scheduled for a [[November 17]], [[2006]] release.

Broccoli's family company, [[Danjaq, LLC]], has co-owned the James Bond film series with [[United Artists]] Corporation since the mid-1970s, when Saltzman sold UA his share of Danjaq. Currently, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] (United Artists' parent) co-distribute the series.

In addition to novels and films, Bond is a prominent character in many [[James Bond games|computer and video games]], [[James Bond comic strips|comic strips]] and [[James Bond comic books|comic books]], and has been the subject of many [[James Bond parodies|parodies]].

==Overview==

===The character===
Commander James Bond, [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve|RNVR]] is an agent of the international arm of the British Secret Service headquartered in London in a tall, grey building overlooking [[Regent's Park]]. Under the cover name &quot;Universal Exports&quot; and later &quot;Transworld Consortium&quot;, Bond's fictional British Secret Service starting in 1995 takes on the actual name of the UK's [[Secret Intelligence Service]], commonly known as MI6. As an agent of the Secret Service, Bond holds code number &quot;007&quot;. The 'double-O' prefix indicates his discretionary [[Licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]] in the performance of his duties.

Bond is the consummate [[womaniser]], drinker, and heavy [[cigarette]] smoker, at one point reaching 70 cigarettes a day. On average, however, Bond smokes 60 a day, although in certain novels Bond does attempt to cut back so that he can accomplish certain feats such as swimming underwater. He is also forced to cut back after being sent to a health farm per his superior's order. Regardless, the literary incarnation continues to smoke through many continuation novels. On film, Bond has been off and on. During the films starring Connery, Lazenby and Dalton Bond was a smoker, while during Moore's and Brosnan's tenure he doesn't smoke cigarettes, although he does occasionally smoke [[cigar]]s. The last time Bond smoked a cigarette on film was in 1989. 

James Bond is famous for ordering his [[Martini cocktail|vodka martinis]] &quot;[[shaken, not stirred]]&quot;, although the literary Bond also drinks [[gin]] martinis and [[bourbon]].

James Bond does have a quirk of being a &quot;know-it-all,&quot; more so on film. In ''[[Goldfinger]]'', he is able to calculate in his head how many trucks it would take to transport all the gold in [[Fort Knox]], and how long the gold would be [[radioactive]] after [[Auric Goldfinger]]'s [[atomic bomb]] detonates inside the vault. Bond's &quot;[[genius]]&quot; became a running joke during Roger Moore's era. Afterwards, it was virtually eliminated.

===Ian Fleming's creation and inspiration===
James Bond was created in February 1952 by Ian Fleming while on vacation at his [[Jamaica]]n estate called Goldeneye. The hero of Fleming's tale, James Bond, was named after an [[United States|American]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|ornithologist of the same name]] who was an expert on [[Caribbean]] birds and had written a definitive book on the subject: ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]], owned a copy of Bond's field guide at Goldeneye. Of the name, Fleming once said &quot;I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, James Bond was much better than something more interesting like 'Peregrine Maltravers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure - an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a Government Department.&quot; {{ref|Chancellor}}

After completing the manuscript for what would later be titled ''Casino Royale'', Fleming allowed his friend [[William Plomer]], a poet and later Fleming's editor, to read it. Plomer liked it enough that he gave the manuscript to [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much, but published it anyway due to the fact that Ian was the younger brother of [[Peter Fleming]], an established travel writer who also put in a good word for Ian.

Since the fictional James Bond's creation, hundreds of reports by various news outlets have suggested names for Ian Fleming's inspiration of Bond. Usually these people have a background of some kind in espionage or other covert operations. Although some names share similarities with Bond, none have ever been confirmed by Fleming, [[Ian Fleming Publications]] or any of Ian Fleming's biographers such as Fleming's assistant and friend, [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]. Most researchers agree that James Bond is a highly romanticised version of Fleming himself; the author was known for his jetsetting lifestyle and reputation as a womaniser. Both, for the most part, went to the same schools, like the same foods (e.g., [[scrambled eggs]]), have the same habits (e.g., drinking and smoking), share the same view on women (e.g., how they should look and how they should dress), and have similar education and military careers both rising to the rank of Commander. Although the character of Bond is not known to be based on anyone but Fleming himself, the look of James Bond, famed for being &quot;suave and sophisticated,&quot; is based on a young [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. In ''Casino Royale'' the character [[Bond girl|Vesper Lynd]] says of Bond, &quot;He reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.&quot; Other characteristics of Bond's look are said to be based on Fleming, such as his height, his hairstyle and his eye colour.

Fleming has, however, admitted to being inspired by true or partially-true events that took place during his career at the [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Naval Intelligence Division]] of the [[Admiralty]]. Most notably, and the basis for ''Casino Royale'', was a trip to [[Lisbon]] that Fleming and the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral Godfrey, took during [[World War II]] en route to the United States. While there they went to the [[Estoril Casino]] in [[Estoril]], which, due to the neutral status of [[Portugal]] had a number of spies of warring regimes present. Fleming claimed that while there he was cleaned out by a &quot;chief [[Germany|German]] agent&quot; at a table playing [[Chemin de Fer]], however, Admiral Godfrey tells a different story, that Fleming only played Portuguese businessmen and that afterwards Ian had fantasised about them being German agents and the excitement of cleaning them out.

===The franchise===
[[Image:FromRussia1959.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[From Russia with Love]]'' is the novel credited with sparking the James Bond craze when it was listed as one of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s favourite books.]]
The James Bond franchise is currently the second all-time highest grossing film franchise in history, after ''[[Star Wars]]''{{ref|filmfranchise}}, and one of the longest running film series in history, spanning 20 [[#Official|official films]], 2 [[#Unofficial|unofficial films]], 1 TV episode based on ''Casino Royale'', and a cartoon television series spinoff. A new film, ''Casino Royale'', is currently in production with an expected release in November 2006. 

The James Bond novels and films have ranged from realistic spy drama to [[science fiction]]. The original books by Fleming are usually dark – lacking [[fantasy]] or gadgets. Instead, they established the formula of unique villains, outlandish plots, and voluptuous women who tend to fall in love with Bond at first sight &amp;mdash; the feeling often being mutual. The films expanded on Fleming's books, adding gadgets from [[Q (James Bond)|Q Branch]], death-defying stunts, and often abandoning the original plotlines for more outlandish and cinema-friendly adventures. The cinematic Bond adventures were initially influenced by earlier spy thrillers such as ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'', and ''[[Journey Into Fear]]'', but later entries became formulaic dramas where Bond saves the world from [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] madmen. Inevitably, a villain tries to kill Bond with a [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]] during which the villain reveals vital information; Bond later escapes and uses the information to thwart the evil plot. In many cases, the villain then dies at Bond's hands, although early Bond films often ended with the villain either escaping or being killed by someone else.

The first actor to play Bond was American [[Barry Nelson]], in the 1954 [[CBS]] television production of ''Casino Royale'' in which the character became a U.S. agent named &quot;Jimmy Bond.&quot; In 1956, [[Bob Holness]] provided the voice of Bond in a [[South Africa]]n [[radio]] adaptation of Fleming's third novel, ''[[Moonraker]]''.

[[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] started the official cinematic run of Bond in [[1962 in film|1962]], with ''[[Dr. No]]'' starring Sean Connery. Their production company, EON Productions, set up a semi-regular schedule of releases; initially annually, then usually once every two years, although there have been a couple times where the gap was larger, usually due to external events. Every Bond film has been a box office success to a lesser or greater degree. They continue to earn substantial profits after their theatrical run via [[videotape]], [[DVD]], and television broadcasts. In the UK, Bond holds three of the top five top spots of [[List of most-watched television episodes|the most-watched television movies]].

Since Bond's peak of popularity in 1965, with the release of ''Thunderball'', critics have often predicted that Bond's successful run would come to an end, usually believing that Bond was out of touch with the times. After the release of ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', George Lazenby quit the role of Bond for this very reason even though he was offered a seven-film contract. By the 1980s, some critics had grown tired of the films, commenting that the perennial [[sexism]] and glamorous locales had become outdated, and that Bond's smooth, unruffled exterior didn't mesh with competing movies like ''[[Die Hard]]''. The hard-edge of Timothy Dalton in the Bond films of the late 80s met a mixed response from moviegoers; some welcomed the earthier style reminiscent of Fleming's character, while others missed the light-hearted approach which characterised the Roger Moore era. While Dalton's final outing, ''Licence to Kill'' (1989), was financially successful, it did not prove as popular as previous Bond films. ''Licence to Kill'''s relative failure is usually blamed on a poor promotional campaign in the United States, Dalton's darker portrayal of Bond, and its status as the first Bond film to be rated [[PG-13]] in the U.S. and &quot;15&quot; in the UK. Regardless, a new Bond film was scheduled for release in 1991; however, legal wrangling over ownership of the character led to a protracted delay that would keep Bond off movie screens for the next six years during which time, Dalton had moved on.

The 1990s saw a revival and renewal of the series beginning with ''[[GoldenEye]]'' in 1995. Pierce Brosnan filled Bond's shoes with an elegant mix of Sean Connery cool and Roger Moore [[wit]]. The combination saw the success of Bond return to its standard stride it hadn't reached since 1979's ''Moonraker''.

==Biography of James Bond==
{{spoiler}}
===Early years===
James Bond is the son of a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] father, Andrew Bond, and a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mother, Monique Delacroix, both of whom died in a mountain [[climbing]] accident in the [[Aiguilles Rouges]], when Bond was 11 years old. He subsequently went to live with his Aunt, Miss Charmian Bond, in [[Kent]]. Bond's family [[motto]], which was adopted by James Bond during &quot;Operation Corona&quot; in the novel ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' is ''Orbis non sufficit'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;The world is not enough.&quot;)

With the exception of the ''[[Young Bond]]'' series of novels by [[Charlie Higson]] launched in 2005, Bond for the most part is an [[ageless]] character in both films and literature. He is roughly in his late thirties. Many Ian Fleming biographers agree that Fleming never really intended to write as many James Bond adventures as he did and to keep writing the novels he had to &quot;tinker with Bond's early life&quot; and change dates to ensure Bond was the appropriate age for the service, particularly due to a statement in ''Moonraker'' that 007 faced mandatory [[retirement]] from the 00 Section at age 45. In the same novel Bond notes that he has only 8 years to go, thus in ''Moonraker'', Bond is 37 years old. This approximate age carries on in continuation novels written by Kingsley Amis, John Gardner, and Raymond Benson.

Due to Fleming's changes of dates and times in which events occurred, Bond's specific birth year is unknown. Most researchers or biographers have concluded that Bond was born in either 1920, 1921 or 1924. According to John Pearson's ''[[James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007]]'', Bond was born on [[November 11]], [[1920]]; no Fleming novel supports this date, in fact, the novel ''You Only Live Twice'' makes a couple references to Bond's birth year being 1924. In the novel, M writes an obituary for James Bond after believing him to be dead. M writes that Bond left school when he was 17 years old and joined the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1941. If Bond was 17 in 1941, then he was born in 1924. Prior to this, Tiger Tanaka, the head of the Japanese Secret Service, states Bond was born in the [[year of the rat]], which supports 1924. A more complex date of birth, according to [[John Griswold]] and his authorised book ''Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations and Chronologies'', is [[November 11]], [[1921]] (November 11, being Pearson's date). Griswold notes that Bond's joining of the Ministry of Defence was originally written in Fleming's manuscript as 1939 (the same year Fleming joined). He contends that a lot of details in Bond's timeline make better sense with the original 1939 date. For instance, if one computes Bond's age for when he was admitted into the Ministry of Defence to when his parents died (1939 - 17 = 1922 + 11 = 1933) Bond would have been 11 in 1933 from January 1 through November 10 if he was born in 1921. 1933 is the year mentioned in ''Casino Royale'' for when Bond 'bought' his first Bentley. Since all of the years claimed for when Bond was born would have made him too young to purchase this Bentley, a more likely scenario is that he inherited it. [[Ian Fleming Publications]] recognised this issue for their ''Young Bond'' series of novels featuring Bond as a teenager in the 1930s and along with its author, Charlie Higson, defined Bond being born in the year 1920.

It is also debated where James Bond was born. According to Pearson, Bond was born near [[Essen, Germany|Essen]], [[Germany]]; however, Charlie Higson, in his novel ''SilverFin'' claims Bond was born in [[Switzerland]]. Regardless, Bond is unquestionably British.

Bond briefly attended [[Eton College]] starting at the age of &quot;12 or thereabouts&quot; (13 in ''Young Bond''), but was expelled after two halves when some &quot;alleged&quot; troubles with one of his maids came to light, although in the short story &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only#&quot;From A View to a Kill&quot;|From a View to a Kill]],&quot; Bond admits to losing his [[virginity]] on his first visit to [[Paris]] at the age of 16. After Eton, Bond attended and continued his education at [[Fettes College]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], his father's old school. In &quot;[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;Octopussy&quot;|Octopussy]]&quot;, Fleming writes that Bond briefly attended the [[University of Geneva]]. With the exception of Fettes, Bond's attendance at these schools parallels Fleming's own life, as he attended these same schools. The film version of James Bond tacks on the additions of Bond being a graduate with a [[academic degree|degree]] in [[Asian languages|Oriental languages]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], as stated in ''You Only Live Twice''. He also attends (presumably at some point) [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] to study [[Danish language|Danish]] in ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', although in the film he's not there to study at all. Bond can speak a variety of different languages, most notably [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], although many times the languages Bond claims to know are contradicted between the film series, Fleming's novel series, and even later films and continuation novels.

In 1941, Bond lied about his age in order to enter the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] during [[World War II]], from which he emerged with the rank of [[Commander]]. Bond maintains this rank while in the employ of the British Secret Service and through further continuation novels and in the films, however, Gardner promoted Bond to [[Captain]] in ''[[Win, Lose or Die]]''. Since Benson's Bond was [[Reboot (continuity)|rebooted]], Bond became a Commander again.

===007===
It is never stated when James Bond became a 00 agent. According to Fleming, after joining the RNVR, Bond is mentioned as to traveling to America, Hong Kong, and Jamaica. It is believed that it is during this time that Bond perhaps joined another organisation such as the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], the 00 Section of the British Secret Service, or perhaps as a commando in Fleming's own 30 Assault Unit (30 AU). One supporting reason is that Fleming describes Bond in the [[Ardennes]] firing a [[bazooka]] in 1944. This action really doesn't make any sense since Bond is supposedly in the [[Royal Navy]]. It can be assumed that by this time Bond has moved on to another organisation. In Bond's obituary from ''You Only Live Twice'', [[M (James Bond)|M]] alludes to Bond's rank as being cover.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''To serve the confidential nature of his duties, he was accorded the rank of lieutenant in the Special Branch of the R.N.V.R., and it is a measure of the satisfaction his services gave to his superiors that he ended the war with the rank of Commander.'' &amp;mdash; M
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bond earns his stripes in the 00 Section by completing two tasks, which Fleming outlines in ''Casino Royale''. The first is the assassination of a [[Japan]]ese cipher expert on the thirty-sixth floor of the [[GE Building|RCA Building]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]]. The second was the assassination of a [[Norwegian]] who became a double agent and betrayed two British agents. Bond travels to [[Stockholm]] where he kills the man in his sleep with a knife.

According to Bond, obtaining a 00 number is not hard so long as you're prepared to kill. Throughout Fleming's novel, further continuation novels, and even the films, Bond's attitude toward his job is similar. Bond dislikes taking life&amp;mdash;resorting to flippant jokes and off-hand remarks as after-the-fact relief, often misinterpreted as cold-bloodedness. Pearson's biography (disputed canonically) suggests Bond first killed as a teenager. The novel ''Goldfinger'' begins with Bond being haunted by memories of a small-time, [[Mexico|Mexican]] gunman he had killed with his bare hands days earlier and on film, specifically in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', he admits that cold-blooded killing is a filthy business. Nonetheless, James Bond does kill when needed, and on film commits acts that might be considered [[murder]] in other circumstances (in ''[[Dr. No]]'', shooting Professor Dent in the back; killing the unarmed [[Elektra King]] in ''The World Is Not Enough''). The literary James Bond was reserved in his licenced killing, sometimes disobeying his orders to kill if the mission could be accomplished by other means. Such is the case in &quot;[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;The Living Daylights&quot;|The Living Daylights]]&quot; where Bond makes a last second decision to disobey his orders and not kill an assassin. Instead Bond intentionally wounds the assassin and still manages to accomplish the mission. He later feels so strongly about his decision that he actually hopes [[M (James Bond)|M]] fires him for it; there are Fleming works in which Bond does not kill anyone. 

The cinematic James Bond (introduced in 1962) already had a history with the Secret Service. In ''Dr. No'', when reluctantly re-equipped with a 7.65 mm [[Walther PPK]] pistol replacing his [[Beretta]] automatic pistol, agent 007 protests, telling [[M (James Bond)|M]] that he has used the weapon for 10 years, suggesting he has been a secret agent for at least that long. Since ''Dr. No'' in both the literary and cinematic versions, Bond has used a Walther PPK in almost every adventure. In the film ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', Bond updates his gun to the latest model of the [[Walther P99]]. In the novels, Gardner replaced the PPK (eventually) with an [[ASP (handgun)|ASP 9mm]].

===Description and love life===
In the novels (notably ''From Russia, With Love''), Bond's physical description has generally been consistent: a three-inch, vertical scar on his left cheek (absent from the cinematic version); blue-grey eyes; a &quot;cruel&quot; mouth; short, dark hair, a comma of which falls on his forehead (greying at the temples in Gardner's novels); and (after ''[[Casino Royale]]'') the faint scar of the [[Russian language|Russian]] [[cyrillic]] letter &quot;Ш&quot; (SH) on the back of one of his hands (carved by a [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] agent).

In both the literary and cinematic versions of ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', James Bond marries, but his bride, [[Tracy Bond|Teresa di Vicenzo]] (Tracy), is killed on their wedding day by his archenemy, [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]; the event resonates in both versions of the character for many years thereafter. In the novels, Bond gets [[revenge]] in the following novel, ''You Only Live Twice'', when he by chance comes across Blofeld in [[Japan]], whilst the cinematic Bond takes on Blofeld in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever]]'' with an ambiguous result. Later, in the pre-titles sequence of ''[[For Your Eyes Only]]'', Bond dispatches a bald, wheelchair-bound man who bears a startling resemblance to Blofeld. The character is not named for legal reasons connected with Eon's ongoing dispute with Kevin McClory and many have speculated that this episode represents both Bond closing the book on Blofeld and Eon demonstrating to McClory that they had no dependence on the Blofeld character.

Bond had one child, by Kissy Suzuki in ''You Only Live Twice'', although he did not know of the boy's existence until sometime later. Exactly when he learned this is not known; however he is aware of his son, James Suzuki, by the time of Raymond Benson's short story &quot;[[James Bond uncollected short stories#&quot;Blast From the Past|Blast From the Past]].&quot;

===Alternate biographies===
An interesting, if wholly [[canon (fiction)|noncanonical]], conjecture about the Bond lineage can be found in [[Alan Moore|Alan Moore's]] comic book series, ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', set in [[Victorian England]]. In it, the portly, sinister, and secretive MI6 agent placed in charge of the League is named [[Campion Bond]]. His superior, the overall director of the top-secret team, is code-named [[M (James Bond)|M]], an obvious reference to the Bond mythos. Later in &quot;League,&quot; it is revealed that this &quot;M&quot; is none other than Professor James Moriarty, the archnemesis of Sherlock Holmes. The second miniseries would continue the Holmes link, as MI6 would be taken over by Mycroft Holmes as the new &quot;M.&quot; Although Moore makes no overt connection between Bond and Campion, the saturation of literary reference in the comics has led fans to propose that Campion is meant to be an ancestor of the modern secret agent. His first name, Campion, is believed to be a reference to fictional detective [[Albert Campion]].

A second (non-canonical) son is suggested in the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[Master of Kung Fu]]. Clive Reston, a supporting character in the series, resembles Bond in many respects and is an MI6 agent himself. While it is never stated explicitly, dialogue strongly hints that Reston is Bond's son and the grand-nephew of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. In his fictional biographies, author [[Philip Jose Farmer]] suggests that Bond belongs in the [[Wold Newton family]] tree along with [[Tarzan]], [[Doc Savage]], and many other fictional heroes. Followers of Farmer's speculations have greatly elaborated on Bond's family.

In February 1952, Ian Fleming began work on his first James Bond novel. At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for [[Kemsley Newspapers]], an organisation owned by the ''[[London Sunday Times]]''. Upon accepting the job, Fleming asked that he be allowed two months vacation per year. Every year thereafter until his death in 1964, Fleming would retreat for the first two months of the year to his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye, to write a James Bond novel.

Between 1953 and 1966, twelve James Bond novels and two short story collections by Fleming were published, with one novel and one short story collection issued posthumously. To this day, it is still debated [[The Man with the Golden Gun#The controversy over the novel|whether Fleming himself actually finished]] 1965's ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', as he died very soon after completing the book. His first anthology of short stories, ''For Your Eyes Only'', mostly consisted of converted screenplays for a [[CBS]] television series based on the character. When the project fell through, Fleming turned them into short stories: (i) &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only#&quot;From A View to a Kill&quot;|From a View to a Kill]]&quot;, (ii) &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only#&quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;|For Your Eyes Only]]&quot;, (iii) &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only#&quot;Risico&quot;|Risico]]&quot;, plus two additional stories, &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only#&quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;|The Hildebrand Rarity]]&quot; and &quot;[[For Your Eyes Only#&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;|Quantum of Solace]]&quot;, which were previously published. The second anthology, ''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'' (in many editions titled only ''Octopussy''), originally only contained two short stories, &quot;[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;Octopussy&quot;|Octopussy]]&quot; and &quot;[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;The Living Daylights&quot;|The Living Daylights&quot;]]; a third story, &quot;[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;The Property of a Lady&quot;|The Property of a Lady]]&quot; was added in the 1967 paperback edition, and a fourth, &quot;[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;007 in New York&quot;|007 in New York]]&quot;, was added in 2002.

===Post-Fleming James Bond novels===
[[Image:ColonelSunOld.jpg|right|thumb|200px|After Fleming's death, Glidrose Productions attempted to continue the Bond series with ''Colonel Sun''.]]
Following Fleming's death in 1964, [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]], publishers of the James Bond novels, planned a new book series, credited to the pseudonym &quot;[[Robert Markham]]&quot; and written by a rotating series of authors. Ultimately, only one Markham novel saw print, 1968's ''[[Colonel Sun]]'' by [[Kingsley Amis]]. Amis had previously written two books on the world of James Bond, the 1964 essay ''The James Bond Dossier'' and the tongue-in-cheek [[1965]] release ''The Book of Bond, or Every Man His Own 007'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;Lt.-Col. William (&quot;Bill&quot;) Tanner&quot;, a recurring character in the Bond novels. Amis had also been claimed for many years as the [[ghost writer]] of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', although this has been debunked by numerous sources.  See [[The Man with the Golden Gun#The controversy over the novel|The controversy over ''The Man with the Golden Gun'']].)

In [[1973 in literature|1973]], Fleming biographer [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] was commissioned by Glidrose to biograph the fictional character James Bond. Pearson wrote ''[[James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007]]'' in the first person as if meeting the secret agent himself. The book was well-received by aficionados&amp;mdash;readers and viewers, alike. Since the book has many discrepancies with Fleming's Bond (for example his birth year), the canonical status of ''James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007'' is debated among fans&amp;mdash;some consider it [[apocryphal]], though at least one publisher, Pan Books, issued it as an official novel along with the rest of Fleming's series for its first paperback edition. Glidrose reportedly considered a new series of novels written by Pearson, but this did not come to pass. Prior to writing this, Pearson had written an early biography of Ian Fleming, ''[[The Life of Ian Fleming]]''.

In [[1977 in literature|1977]], the film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' was released and was subsequently novelised and published by Glidrose due to the radical difference between the script and Fleming's novel of the same name. This would happen again with [[1979 in literature|1979]]'s ''[[Moonraker]]''. Both novelisations were written by [[screenwriter]] [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] and were the first official novelisations, although technically, Fleming's ''Thunderball'' was a novelisation having been based on scripts by himself, [[Kevin McClory]], and [[Jack Whittingham]] (although it predated the movie), and the ''For Your Eyes Only'' collection was also, for the most part, based upon unproduced scripts.

In the 1980s, the series was finally revived with new novels by John Gardner; between [[1981]] and [[1996]], he wrote fourteen James Bond novels and two screenplay novelisations, surpassing Fleming's original output. The biggest change in Gardner's series was updating 007's world to the 1980s; however, it would keep the characters the same age as they were in Fleming's novels. Generally Gardner's series is considered a success although their canonical status is disputed.

In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health, and American Raymond Benson quickly replaced him. As a James Bond novelist, Benson was initially controversial for being American, and for ignoring much of the continuity established by Gardner. Benson had previously written ''[[The James Bond Bedside Companion]]'', a book dedicated to Ian Fleming, the official novels, and the films. The book was initially released in [[1984 in literature|1984]] and later updated in [[1988 in literature|1988]]. Benson also contributed to the creation of several modules in the popular ''James Bond 007'' [[role-playing game]] in the 1980s. Benson wrote six James Bond novels, three novelisations, and three short stories.

Benson's three short stories [[James Bond uncollected short stories|remain uncollected]], unlike previous short stories from Ian Fleming. Benson also wrote a fourth short story entitled &quot;[[James Bond uncollected short stories#Unpublished story|The Heart of Erzulie]]&quot; that was rejected for publication.

Benson abruptly resigned as Bond novelist at the end of 2002, despite having previously announced plans to write a short story collection. Low sales figures for the books, and plans by Ian Fleming Publications to focus on reissuing Fleming's original novels for the 50th anniversary of the character, were among reasons speculated by fans as to why Benson departed. The year 2003 marked the first year since 1980 that a new James Bond novel had not been published.

On [[August 28]], [[2005]], Ian Fleming Publications confirmed it is planning to publish a one-off adult Bond novel in [[2008]] to mark what would have been Ian Fleming's 100th birthday. This would feature the adult version of the character as opposed to the &quot;Young Bond&quot; character of the recent Charlie Higson books (see below). Although it has been suggested a &quot;big name&quot; author might take on the task, the publishers have yet to approach anyone about this project [http://www.ianflemingcentre.com/index.cfm?page=news].

===Young Bond===
{{main|Young Bond}}

In April 2004, Ian Fleming Publications (Glidrose) announced a new series of James Bond books. Instead of continuing from where Raymond Benson ended in 2002, the new series featured James Bond as a thirteen-year-old boy attending [[Eton College]]. Written by [[Charlie Higson]] (''[[The Fast Show]]'') the series is intended to align faithfully with the adult Bond's back-story established by Fleming and Fleming only. Since the concept was announced the series has taken heavy criticism for being aimed at the &quot;[[Harry Potter]] audience&quot; and has been seen by some as a desperate attempt to find a new audience for Bond. Regardless, the first novel became a bestseller in the United Kingdom and was released to good reviews. A second novel was released in the UK in January 2006. The series is currently planned out for five novels according to Charlie Higson.

The ''Young Bond'' series is expected to add [[graphic novel]]s in 2006. It is currently unknown whether these will be adaptations of Higson's books.

===The Moneypenny Diaries===
{{main|The Moneypenny Diaries}}

A new trilogy of novels &quot;edited&quot; by [[Samantha Weinberg]] under the pseudonym [[Kate Westbrook]] entitled ''[[The Moneypenny Diaries]]'' was released by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] publishers that centres on the character of [[Miss Moneypenny]], [[M (James Bond)|M]]'s personal secretary. The first installment of the trilogy, subtitled ''Guardian Angel'', was released on [[October 10]], [[2005]]. Weinberg is the first woman to write officially licensed Bond-related literature (although [[Johanna Harwood]] had previously co-written the screenplay for ''Dr. No'').

The novels had originally been touted as the secret journal of a &quot;real&quot; Miss Moneypenny and that James Bond was a possible pseudonym for a genuine intelligence officer, an idea shared by John Pearson's earlier biography, ''James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007''. John Murray admitted on [[August 28]], [[2005]] that the books were a spoof after an investigation by ''The Sunday Times'' of London. Ian Fleming Publications, who had previously refused to comment as to whether the book was authorised, officially confirmed the book was and always had been a project by them on the day of the book's publication.

A second volume has been tentatively scheduled for publication in October 2006.[http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/2999-1.shtml]

===Other Bond-related fiction===
In [[1967]], Glidrose authorised publication of ''[[003½: The Adventures of James Bond Junior]]'' written by [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]] under the pseudonym R D Mascott. This book is for young-adult readers, and chronicles the adventures of 007's nephew (despite the inaccurate title).

In 1991 an animated television series, ''[[James Bond Jr]]'', ran for 65 episodes. The series was mildly successful and spawned six novelisations published in 1992 by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] writing as John Vincent, a 12 issue comic book series by [[Marvel Comics]] published in 1992, as well as a [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Eurocom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] in 1991.

[[Russia|Russians]] were often the villains in Fleming's [[Cold War]]-era novels in at least some form. In [[1968]], they hit back with a spy novel of their own called ''[[The Zakhov Mission|Avakoum Zahov vs. 07]]'' by [[Andrei Guliashki]], in which a [[communism|communist]] hero finally and forcefully defeats 007.

In addition to numerous [[fan fiction]] pieces written since the character was created, there have been two stories written by well-known authors claiming to have been contracted by Glidrose. The first in 1966, was ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'' by [[Geoffrey Jenkins]], a friend of Ian Fleming who claimed to have developed with Fleming a diamond-smuggling storyline similar to ''Diamonds Are Forever'' as early as the 1950s. According to the book ''The Bond Files'' by [[Andy Lane]] and [[Paul Simpson]], soon after Ian Fleming died, Glidrose Productions commissioned Jenkins to write a James Bond novel. The novel was never published. Some sources have suggested that Jenkins novel was to be published under the Markham pseudonym. The second story, 1985's ''[[The Killing Zone]]'' by [[James Hatfield|Jim Hatfield]] goes so far as to have been privately published as well as claim on the cover that it was published by Glidrose; however it is highly unlikely that Glidrose contacted Hatfield to write a novel since at the time John Gardner was the official author. The text of ''The Killing Zone'' is available on the [[Internet]] and can be found [http://www.universalexports.net/Books/killingzone.shtml here].

In [[1997]], the British publisher [[B.T. Batsford]] produced ''[[Your Deal, Mr. Bond]]'', a collection of [[bridge (card game)|bridge]]-related short stories by [[Phillip King (writer)| Phillip King]] and [[Robert King]]. The title story features James Bond, M, and other characters and features an epic bridge game between Bond and the villain, Saladin. No credit is given to Ian Fleming Publications, suggesting this rare story may have been unauthorised; a photo of Sean Connery as Bond is featured on the cover of the book.

In Clive Cussler's novel, &quot;Night Probe&quot;, there is a character named Brian Shaw, whom the hero, Dirk Pitt suspects to be James Bond. Brian Shaw's choice of pistol, a .25 caliber, echoes that of James Bond's preference for the .25 caliber Beretta. Shaw's old office was located in Regent Park, and he was supposed to have been on SMERSH's hit list.

==Films==
===Official===
The James Bond film series has its own traditions, many of which date back to the very first movie in 1962.

Since ''Dr. No'', every official James Bond film begins with what is known as the [[James Bond gun barrel sequence]], which introduces agent 007. The gun barrel is seen from the assassin's perspective&amp;mdash;looking down at a walking James Bond, who quickly turns and shoots; the scene reddens (signifying the spilling of the would-be assassin's blood), the gun barrel dissolves to a white circle, and the film begins.

[[Image:Kleinman gunbarrel.jpg|left|275px|thumb|Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in the gun barrel sequence]]
After the gun barrel sequence, every film starting with ''From Russia with Love'' (1963), would start with a pre-credits teaser, also popularly known as the &quot;opening [[gambit]].&quot; Usually the scene features 007 finishing up a previous case before taking on the case from the film, and does not always relate to his main mission. Some of the teasers tie in with the plot of the film (as in ''Live and Let Die''). Since ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' in 1977, they have often involved attention-grabbing action sequences, which have tended to become larger and more elaborate with each successive film. The [[1999]] film ''The World Is Not Enough'' currently holds the record as the longest Bond teaser ever, running more than 15 minutes; most teasers run for less than five.
[[Image:Kleinman titlecredits.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Title credits from ''GoldenEye'' representing the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War]]]]
When the teaser sequence is finished, the opening credits begin during which an arty display of scantily clad and even (discreetly) naked females can be seen doing a variety of activities from dancing, jumping on a trampoline, to shooting weapons. This sequence is a trademark and a staple of the James Bond films. The best known of the Bond title designers is [[Maurice Binder]], who created these sequences for fourteen 007 films from 1962 to 1989. Since Binder's death in 1991, [[Daniel Kleinman]] has designed the credits and has introduced CG elements not present during Binder's era. While the credits run, the main theme of the film is usually sung by a popular artist of the time. For the most part, the credits are unrelated to the plot of the film, although the design may reflect an overall theme (for example, ''You Only Live Twice'' uses a [[Japan|Japanese]] motif as well as images of a [[volcano]], both of which are elements of the movie itself). ''Goldfinger'' uses short glimpses of the film projected onto women's bodies. ''For Your Eyes Only'' begins with [[Sheena Easton]] singing the title song on-screen. ''[[Die Another Day]]'' was unusual in that the images shown in that film's opening credits advance the storyline by depicting Bond's torture following his capture by the North Koreans. The credits for ''GoldenEye'' depict the fall of the Soviet Union and thus provide a transition from the pre-fall era of the opening sequence to the post-fall setting of the rest of the narrative. The Bond films are unusual in retaining full opening and closing credits; since the late 1970s it has become common for most films to save detailed credits for the end, with only principal actors and crew listed at the beginning. 

[[Image:James bond world locations.PNG|thumb|[[James Bond locations|Countries James Bond visited]]]]

Agent 007's famous introduction, &quot;Bond. James Bond&quot; became a [[catch phrase]] after it was first muttered (with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth) by Sean Connery in ''Dr. No''. Since then, the phrase has entered the [[lexicon]] of Western [[popular culture]] as the epitome of polished, understated machismo. On [[June 21]], [[2005]] the catch phrase was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the [[American Film Institute]] as part of their [[100 Years Series]] {{ref|AFI}}. The catch phrase, &quot;a martini. [[Shaken, not stirred]],&quot; which was first uttered by Bond in ''Goldfinger'' (although it is actually first said on screen by the villain in ''Dr. No'') was also honoured as #90 on the same list.

Every film, except ''Dr. No'' (1962) and &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), has the line: &quot;James Bond will return. . .&quot; or &quot;James Bond will be back&quot; during or after the final credits. Up until ''Octopussy'' (1983) the end-credit line would also name the next title in the film series (&quot;James Bond will return in...&quot;). Over the years the films have incorrectly named the sequel three times. The first, 1964's ''Goldfinger'', in early prints announced Bond to return in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', however, the producers changed their mind shortly after release and subsequently made the correction in future prints of the film. In 1977, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' stated Bond would return in ''For Your Eyes Only'', however, EON Productions had decided to instead take advantage of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' space craze and release a film adaptation of Fleming's ''Moonraker'', which was changed to a plot involving outer space. Thirdly, ''Octopussy'' (1983) incorrectly states the title of the next film as ''From A View To A Kill'', the original literary title of ''A View to a Kill''.

Every aficionado has a favourite James Bond: Sean Connery&amp;mdash;the tough guy, his machismo ready beneath the polished persona, George Lazenby&amp;mdash;the controversial ultra-macho man, equally loved and despised, Roger Moore&amp;mdash;the sophisticate, a perfect gentleman, rarely mussing his hair whilst saving the world, Timothy Dalton&amp;mdash;the hard-edged literary character, and Pierce Brosnan&amp;mdash;the polished man of action. On [[October 14]], [[2005]], EON Productions announced that Daniel Craig would be the sixth official James Bond and will star in the latest 007 adventure, ''Casino Royale'' in 2006. Work is also already underway on the script for the follow-up film, currently referred to by its working title, ''Bond 22'' 

There's also lively debate on the best Bond movie, with most major film critics giving the top mark to either ''From Russia with Love'' (Connery's favourite, as he re-asserted in a 2002 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] interview with [[Sam Donaldson]]) or its brassy followup, ''Goldfinger.'' Despite George Lazenby's short tenure in the tuxedo, some reviewers have also warmed to ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (with [[Leonard Maltin]]'s ''Movies on TV'' review book stating it might have been the best Bond film ever had Connery appeared in it).

===Unofficial===
In 1954, [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming $1,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] for the rights to adapt ''Casino Royale'' into a one hour [[television]] adventure as part of their ''[[Climax! (television)|Climax!]]'' series. The episode featured [[United States|American]] [[Barry Nelson]] in the role of &quot;Jimmy Bond&quot;, an agent for the fictional &quot;Combined Intelligence&quot; agency. The rights to ''Casino Royale'' were subsequently sold to producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] who turned Fleming's first novel into a [[Parody|spoof]] featuring actor [[David Niven]] as one of ''six'' James Bonds. The instrumental theme music was a hit for [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]]. For more information, see [[Casino Royale#Adaptation history|the history of ''Casino Royale'']].

When plans for a James Bond film were scrapped in the late 1950s, a story treatment entitled ''Thunderball'', written by Ian Fleming, [[Kevin McClory]] and [[Jack Whittingham]], was adapted as Fleming's ninth Bond novel. Initially the novel only credited Fleming. McClory filed a lawsuit that would eventually award him the film rights to the novel in 1963. Afterwards McClory made a deal with EON Productions to produce a film adaptation starring Sean Connery. The deal specifically stated that McClory couldn't reproduce another adaptation until a set period of time had elapsed. McClory did so in 1983 by producing the film ''Never Say Never Again'', which featured Sean Connery for a seventh time as 007. ''Never Say Never Again'' was not made by Broccoli's production company, [[EON Productions]], and is, therefore, not considered a part of the official film series. A second attempt by McClory to remake ''Thunderball'' in the 1990s with [[Sony Pictures]] was halted by legal action which resulted in Sony Pictures abandoning their aspirations for a rival James Bond series. McClory to this day still claims to own the film rights to ''Thunderball'', though MGM and EON claim those rights have expired. For more in-depth information, see [[Thunderball#The controversy over the novel|the controversy over ''Thunderball'']].

===Other films pertaining to James Bond===
{{main|James Bond parodies}}
James Bond has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the cinematic spy film genre. The ''[[Austin Powers]]'' series by writer and actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] and other parodies such as ''[[Johnny English]]'' (2003), the &quot;[[Our Man Flint|Flint]]&quot; series starring [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint, and ''Casino Royale'' (1967) are testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. 1960s TV imitations of James Bond such as ''[[I Spy]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' went on to become popular successes in their own right. The latter having had contributions by Fleming towards its creation; the show's lead character, &quot;[[Napoleon Solo]],&quot; was named after a character in Fleming's novel ''Goldfinger'' and Fleming also suggested the character name April Dancer, which was later used in the spinoff series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]''. A reunion television movie, ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1983), is notable for featuring a cameo by George Lazenby as James Bond; for legal reasons, his character, a tribute to Ian Fleming, was credited as &quot;JB&quot;.

&quot;[[The James Bond Theme]]&quot; was written by [[Monty Norman]] and was first orchestrated by the [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] Orchestra for 1962's ''Dr. No'', although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. Barry went on to compose the [[Film score|scores]] for eleven Bond films in addition to his uncredited contribution to ''Dr. No'', and is credited with the creation of &quot;[[The 007 Theme|007]]&quot;, which was used as an alternate Bond theme in several films, and the popular orchestrated theme &quot;[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]&quot;. Both &quot;The James Bond Theme&quot; and &quot;On Her Majesty's Secret Service&quot; have been [[remix]]ed a number of times by popular artists, including [[Art of Noise]], [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], and the [[Propellerheads]].

Barry's legacy was followed by [[David Arnold]], in addition to other well-known composers and record producers such as [[George Martin]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], and [[Eric Serra]]. Arnold is the series' current composer of choice, and was recently signed to compose the score for the his fourth consecutive Bond film, ''Casino Royale''.

The Bond films are known for their theme songs heard during the title credits, sung by well-known popular singers (which have included [[Tina Turner]], [[Wings (band)|Paul McCartney &amp; Wings]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and [[Duran Duran]], among many others.) [[Shirley Bassey]] performed three themes in total, and is the only singer to have been associated with more than one film. ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' is the only Bond film with a solely instrumental theme, though [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ballad &quot;[[We Have All the Time in the World]]&quot;, which serves as Bond and his wife Tracy's love song and whose title is Bond's last line in the film, is considered the unofficial theme. The main theme for ''Dr. No'' is the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;, although the opening credits also include an untitled [[bongo]] interlude, and concludes with a vocal [[Calypso]]-flavoured rendition of &quot;[[Three Blind Mice]]&quot; entitled &quot;Kingston Calypso&quot; that sets the scene. ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' also opens with an instrumental version over the title credits (which then segues into the ''James Bond Theme''), but Matt Monro's vocal version also appears twice in the film, including the closing credits; the Monro version is generally considered the film's main theme, even though it doesn't appear during the opening credits.

==Video games==
{{Main|James Bond games}}

[[Image:Everything or Nothing.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''[[Everything or Nothing]]'' was Pierce Brosnan's final appearance as James Bond]]
In [[1983]], the first Bond video game, developed and published by [[Parker Brothers]], was released for the [[Atari 2600]], the [[Atari 5200]], the [[Commodore 64]], and the [[Colecovision]]. Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines.

Bond video games, however, didn't reach their popular stride until [[1997]]'s ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'' by [[Rare (video game company)|Rare]] for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Subsequently, virtually every Bond video game has attempted to copy ''GoldenEye 007''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s accomplishment and features to varying degrees of success. In [[2004]], [[Electronic Arts]] released a game entitled ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' that had nothing to do with either the video game ''GoldenEye'' or the film of the same name, and Bond himself plays only a minor role in which he is &quot;killed&quot; in the beginning during a virtual mission similar to the climax at Fort Knox in the film ''Goldfinger''.

Electronic Arts has to date released seven games, including the popular ''[[Everything or Nothing]]'', which broke away from the [[first-person shooter]] element found in ''GoldenEye'' and went to a [[third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective. It was also the first game to feature well known actors including [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Heidi Klum]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond, although several previous games have used Brosnan's likeness as Bond. In 2005, Electronic Arts released another game in the same vein as ''Everything or Nothing'', this time a video game adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', which allowed the player to play as Bond with the likeness of [[Sean Connery]]. This was the second game based on a Connery Bond film (the first was a 1980s [[text adventure]] adaptation of ''Goldfinger'') and the first to use the actor's likeness as agent 007. Connery himself recorded new voiceovers for the game, the first time the actor has played Bond in 22 years.

==Comic strips and comic books==
{{main articles|[[James Bond comic strips]] and [[James Bond comic books]]}}

In [[1957]] the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper owned by [[Lord Beaverbrook]], approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. After initial reluctance by Fleming who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed and the first strip ''[[Casino Royale#Comic strip adaptation|Casino Royale]]'' was published in [[1958]]. Since then many illustrated adventures of James Bond have been published, including every Ian Fleming novel as well as Kingsley Amis' ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', and most of Fleming's short stories. Later, the comic strip produced original stories, continuing until [[1983]].

[[Titan Books]] is presently reprinting these comic strips in an ongoing series of [[graphic novel]]-style collections; by the end of 2005 it had completed reprinting all Fleming-based adaptations as well as ''Colonel Sun'' and had moved on to reprinting original stories.

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years, as well as numerous original stories.

==Bond characters==
{{main articles|[[List of James Bond allies]], [[List of James Bond villains]], and [[Bond girl]]}}

The James Bond series of novels and films have a plethora of interesting allies and villains. Bond's superiors and other officers of the British Secret Service are generally known by letters such as [[M (James Bond)|M]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. In the novels (but not in the films), Bond has had two secretaries, [[List of James Bond allies#Ponsonby, Loelia|Loelia Ponsonby]] and [[List of James Bond allies#Goodnight, Mary|Mary Goodnight]], who in the films typically have their roles and lines transferred to M's secretary [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Occasionally Bond is assigned to work a case with his good friend, [[Felix Leiter]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. In the films, Leiter appeared regularly during the Connery era, only once during Moore's tenure, and in both Dalton films; however, he was only played by the same actor twice.

Bond's women, particularly in the films, often have [[double entendre]] names, leading to coy jokes, for example, &quot;[[Pussy Galore (James Bond)|Pussy Galore]]&quot; in ''Goldfinger'' (a name invented by Fleming), &quot;Plenty O'Toole&quot; in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever]]'', and &quot;[[Xenia Onatopp]]&quot; (a villainess sexually excited by [[strangling]] men with her thighs) in ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The aggressiveness of Bond's sexual conquests occasionally while his lovers eventually return his advances, he does not take the initial &quot;no&quot; for an answer. Despite Bond's philandering, most end up, if not in love with him, at least subdued by him. Since Brosnan's tenure, however, the character has taken on a (relatively) more progressive outlook on women; he respects the new, female M (played by [[Judi Dench]]) and has let a few women, particularly [[Paris Carver]] and Elektra King, get under his skin.  

Throughout both the novels and the films there have only been a handful of recurring characters. Some of the more memorable ones include [[List of James Bond allies#Tanner, Bill|Bill Tanner]], [[List of James Bond allies#Mathis, Rene|Rene Mathis]], [[Felix Leiter]], and [[List of James Bond allies#Wade, Jack|Jack Wade]].

==Vehicles &amp; gadgets==
{{main articles|[[List of James Bond vehicles]] and [[List of James Bond gadgets]]}}

[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Aston Martin DB5]] is the most famous and recognised Bond car]]
Exotic espionage equipment and vehicles are very popular elements of James Bond's literary and cinematic missions; these items often prove critically important to Bond removing obstacles to the success of his missions.

Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as ''From Russia with Love's'' booby-trapped [[attaché case]]; in ''Dr. No'', Bond's sole gadgets were a [[geiger counter]] and a wristwatch with a luminous (and [[radioactive]]!) face. The gadgets, however, assumed a higher, spectacular profile in the 1964 film  ''Goldfinger''; its success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to 007. Some films, in the opinion of many critics and fans, have had excessive amounts of gadgets or extremely outlandish gadgets and vehicles, specifically 1979's [[science fiction]]-oriented ''Moonraker'' and 2002's ''Die Another Day'' in which Bond's Aston Martin could become [[Cloaking device|invisible]] due to a technology Q refers to as [[adaptive camouflage]]. Since ''Moonraker'' subsequent productions struggled with balancing gadget content against the story's capacities, without implying a technology-dependent man, to mixed results.

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]] seen in ''Goldfinger'', ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', and ''Tomorrow Never Dies''. Although the films used a number of different Aston Martin DB5s on film and for publicity one of them was sold in January 2006 at an auction in [[Arizona]] for $2,090,000 (USD) to an unnamed European collector. That specific car was originally sold for £5,000 in 1970 {{ref|DB5}}.

In Fleming's books, Bond had a penchant for &quot;battleship grey&quot; [[Bentley]]s, while Gardner awarded the agent a modified [[Saab 900]] Turbo nicknamed the [[Licence Renewed#The Silver Beast|Silver Beast]] and later a [[Bentley Mulsanne]] Turbo.

==Trivia==
*Many people assume the Bond producers would never hire an American to portray the character in the official film series. However, American actors have been hired on two occasions, and approached about playing Bond on several others. [[Adam West]] was offered the chance to appear in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' when Connery chose not to return to the role, but turned down the offer. [[John Gavin]] was hired in [[1970]] to replace Lazenby, but Connery was lured back at the eleventh hour and it was he who appeared in ''Diamonds Are Forever'' instead of Gavin. [[Burt Reynolds]] was also asked by Cubby Broccoli in the early '70s to replace Connery after ''Diamonds Are Forever'', but turned him down. [[James Brolin]] was hired in [[1983]] to replace Moore, and was preparing to shoot ''[[Octopussy]]'' when the producers convinced Moore to return. Several other American actors, including [[Patrick McGoohan]], and [[Robert Wagner]], have been offered the role only to turn it down. To date, the only American to play the role is [[Barry Nelson]], albeit unofficially in the Americanised version of the character in the 1954 TV adaptation of ''Casino Royale''.
*[[Michael Gambon]], who co-starred with current Bond actor Daniel Craig in ''[[Layer Cake]]'' and ''[[Sylvia (movie)|Sylvia]]'', was asked by Cubby Broccoli to audition for the role in 1970 to replace Lazenby. Gambon spoke of the situation in an interview: ''When he told me he was considering me for the part of 007 himself, I was amazed. I objected, &quot;But I'm bald.&quot; &quot;So was Sean &amp;mdash; we'll get around it.&quot; he replied. &quot;But I've got breasts like a woman,&quot; I continued. &quot;Then we'll use ice packs before the love scenes like we did with Sean,&quot; he replied.'' [http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/48252004.htm]
*While initially skeptical about Connery being chosen to play Bond (at one point dismissing him as an &quot;overgrown stuntman&quot;), Fleming liked his portrayal so much that he eventually added background to the character in the novels so that his father was Scottish.
*Accounts vary wildly in regards to which actor was Fleming's initial choice for the film version of Bond. Sources have suggested that Fleming favored [[Roger Moore]], [[James Mason]], and [[Cary Grant]], among others. According to Sir John Morgan, Ian Fleming's step son-in-law, Fleming favored little-known actor Edward Underdown, who played an Air Vice Marshall in ''[[Thunderball]]''. [http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/1716-1.shtml]
*Dalton was originally contracted for three films, with the third film planned for release in 1991. Although never officially confirmed, numerous sources have suggested the title was to be ''The Property of a Lady'', after the short story from the collection ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#&quot;The Property of a Lady&quot;|Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''. Legal wranglings over ownership of the Bond franchise, however, led to the series being put on hiatus until [[1994]].
*With the release of ''Casino Royale'', Craig will become the first actor with blond hair to have portrayed Bond; although Roger Moore did sport sandy colored hair in his first few Bond films, he is not considered a blond.
*[[Joe Don Baker]] played [[Brad Whitaker]], the villain in [[The Living Daylights]].  Baker shows up in later James Bond films, portraying [[Jack Wade]], one of James Bond's allies in both [[Goldeneye]] and [[Tomorrow Never Dies]].
*[[Desmond Llewelyn]] holds a record, appearing in 17 of the James Bond films as &quot;Q,&quot; aka [[Major Boothroyd]], and head of Q-branch.  In [[The World is Not Enough]], [[John Cleese]] is introduced as Q's assistant, whom Bond teasingly refers to as &quot;R.&quot; Despite Cleese receiving a credit as R, there is no hint in the dialogue that this is an official title. In [[Die Another Day]], Cleese becomes the new Q, the old Q having presumably retired. In fact Llewelyn had been killed in a car crash shortly after the release of the previous film.
*Five Ian Fleming titles have thus far never been used as film titles: ''The Property of a Lady'', ''Quantum of Solace'', ''Risico'', ''The Hildebrand Rarity'', and ''007 in New York''.
*[[Sean Connery]] starred in the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|Motion Picture version]] of [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], which has a 'supposed' link to the roots of James Bond's ancestry.
*[[George Lucas]] has said on multiple occasions that Connery's portrayal of the character was one of the primary inspirations for his [[Indiana Jones]] character. As a tribute to this, when casting his third Indiana Jones film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'', Lucas chose Connery for the role of Indiana's father, with his reasoning being &quot;Who else could play Indiana Jones' father, but the guy who inspired all of this in the first place, James Bond himself!&quot; (Sean Connery)
*The Clive Cussler book Night Probe features an older British character who was a former MI6 agent who appears to be James Bond. This character has, however, retired due to becoming too famous, but is lured out of retirement for one last mission.

'''Japanese''' (日本語, {{Audio|ja-nihongo.ogg|''Nihongo''}}) is a language spoken by over 127 million people, mainly in [[Japan]], but also by Japanese emigrant communities around the world. It is considered an [[agglutinative language]] and is distinguished by a complex system of [[Japanese honorifics|honorifics]] reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary which indicate the relative status of speaker and listener. The sound inventory of Japanese is relatively small, and it has a lexically-distinctive [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent]] system.

Japanese has been heavily influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] over a period of at least 1,500 years.  Japanese is written with a mix of [[Chinese character]]s ([[kanji]]) and a modified [[syllabary]], [[kana]], also originally based on Chinese characters. Much vocabulary has been imported from Chinese, or created on Chinese models.

==Classification==

[[historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] who specialize in Japanese agree that it is one of the two members of the [[Japonic language|Japonic]] language family, but remain divided as to the origins of the Japonic languages. An older view, still widely held by some linguists and many non-linguists, is that Japanese is a [[language isolate]].

As for its relation to other languages, there are several theories (presented roughly in descending order of certainty):

* Japanese is a member of the [[Altaic languages|Altaic language]] family. Other languages in this group include [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and (according to most proponents) [[Korean language|Korean]]. Evidence for this theory lies in the fact that like [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], Japanese is an [[agglutinative language]]. Additionally, there are a suggestive number of apparently regular correspondences in basic vocabulary, such as ''ishi'' &quot;stone&quot; to Turkic ''daş'', ''yon'' &quot;four&quot; to Turkic ''dört'', ''kura'' &quot;saddle&quot; to Turkic ''kürtün'', ''kiru'' &quot;to cut&quot; to Turkic ''kir-'', ''inu'' &quot;dog&quot; to Turkic ''it'', ''kuro'' &quot;black&quot; and ''kurai'' &quot;dark&quot; to Turkic ''köl'' &quot;shadow&quot;, etc. These examples originate from [http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/query.cgi?root=config&amp;basename=\data\alt\altet this database], which contains a comprehensive list of comparisons and  theoretical Altaic etymologies.
* Japanese is a relative of extinct languages spoken by historic cultures of [[Korea]] and [[Manchuria]]. The best attested of these is the language of [[Goguryeo]] (a.k.a. Koguryo), with the more poorly-attested languages of [[Baekje]] (a.k.a. Paekche) and [[Fuyu|Buyeo]] (a.k.a Puyo) hypothesized to also be related. &lt;!-- COMMENTING OUT - SEE TALK PAGE   Japanese is related to modern [[Korean language|Korean]] based primarily on near-identical grammar, but there is scarce lexical similarity between the two; supporters of the Buyeo languages theory generally do not include modern Korean as part of that family. --&gt;Supporters of the Buyeo languages theory generally do not include modern [[Korean language|Korean]] as part of that family because it is thought to have derived from the ancient language of [[Silla]].The limited data on these languages, as well as these cultures' historic ties, are the primary evidence. This has been largely subsumed into the Altaic theory. 

* Japanese is a relative of [[Korean language|Korean]]. This theory is based on the high degree of similarity between Japanese and Korean grammar. Proponents of this theory have also proposed Japanese-Korean cognates. The idea of a Japanese-Korean relationship has been largely subsumed into the Altaic theory. 
* Japanese is a [[creole language]]. Phonological similarities and geographical proximity to [[Austronesian languages]] have led to the theory that Japanese may be a kind of creole, with an [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] [[substratum]] and an Austronesian [[superstratum]], or vice versa.
* Japanese is a ''purely'' Austronesian language. This theory enjoys little currency, since the grammar and lexis of Japanese are vastly different from those of any known Austronesian language. Proponents of this theory point out examples of convergent lexis such as Japanese ''hina'' &quot;doll&quot; and ''hime'' &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;princess&quot; as cognate with the [[Maori language|Māori]] word ''hine'' &quot;girl&quot;, or Japanese ''kaku'' &quot;to write, to scratch&quot; with the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''kākau'' &quot;to write, to tattoo&quot;.  However, it is important to note that many totally unrelated languages exhibit chance occurences of convergent lexis.
* Susumu Ohno and other linguists including R. Caidwell, Susumu Shiba and Fujiwara Akira have suggested a possible relationship between Japanese and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], a member of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] family spoken in [[South India]]. Evidence for this theory is that Japanese and Tamil are both [[agglutinative language]]s and also have similar [[phonetics]], [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], and [[retroflex consonant]]s.

Specialists in Japanese [[historical linguistics]] all agree that Japanese is related to the [[Ryukyuan languages]] (including [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]); together, Japanese and Ryukyuan are grouped in the [[Japonic languages]]. Among these specialists, the possibility of a genetic relation to [[Goguryeo]] has the most evidence; relationship to [[Korean language|Korean]] is considered plausible but is still up to debate; the Altaic hypothesis has somewhat less currency, though it has grown significantly more respectable in recent years, primarily due to the work of [[Sergei Starostin]], et al. Almost all specialists reject the idea that Japanese could be genetically related to [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]/[[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] or [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], and the idea that Japanese could be related to [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is almost entirely excluded.

It should be noted that linguistic studies, like all fields, can be strongly affected by national politics and other non-academic factors. For example, most linguists would say that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] are essentially the same language, and that they are known as two different languages for political reasons. Japan's long-standing rivalries and enmities with virtually all of its neighbours make the study of linguistic connection particularly fraught with such political tensions. However, these tensions are less prevalent among non-Japanese researchers.

==Geographic distribution==
Although Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has been and is still sometimes spoken in countries besides Japan. When Japan occupied [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], parts of [[China]], and various Pacific islands, locals in [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|those countries]] were forced to learn Japanese in empire-building programmes. As a result, there are still many people in these countries who speak Japanese instead of or as well as the local languages. In addition, emigrants from Japan, the majority of whom are found in [[Brazil]], where the biggest Japanese community outside Japan is found, [[Australia]] (especially [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]], and [[Melbourne]]), and the [[United States]] (notably [[California]] and [[Hawaii]]), also frequently speak Japanese. There is also a small community in [[Davao]], [[Philippines]]. Their descendants (known as ''nikkei'' 日系, literally Japanese descendants), however, rarely speak Japanese fluently. There are estimated to be several million non-Japanese studying the language as well.

=== Official status ===
Japanese is the official language of Japan, and Japan is the only country to have Japanese as an official working language. There are two forms of the language considered standard: {{nihongo|''hyōjungo''|標準語|}} or standard Japanese, and {{nihongo|''kyōtsūgo''|共通語|}} or the common language. As government policy has modernized Japanese, many of the distinctions between the two have blurred. ''Hyōjungo'' is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications, and is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.

Standard Japanese can also be divided into {{nihongo|''bungo''|文語|}} or &quot;literary language,&quot; and {{nihongo|''kōgo''|口語|}} or &quot;oral language,&quot; which have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. ''Bungo'' was the main method of writing Japanese until the late 1940s, and still has relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in ''bungo'', although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). ''Kōgo'' is the predominant method of speaking and writing Japanese today, although ''bungo'' grammar and vocabulary occasionally appears in modern Japanese for poetic effect.

===Dialects===
{{main|Japanese dialects}}

Dozens of dialects are spoken in Japan. The profusion is due to the mountainous island terrain and Japan's long history of both external and internal isolation. Dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent, inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[vocabulary]], particle usage, and pronunciation. Some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories, although this is uncommon.

Dialects from less central regions, such as the [[Tōhoku Region|Tōhoku]] or [[Tsushima]] dialect may be unintelligible to speakers from other parts of the country.
